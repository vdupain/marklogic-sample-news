            <p class="introduction">About 50,000 people
are still without power a day after a heavy rainstorm in Toronto
flooded parts of Canada's largest city.</p>
            <p>More than 90mm (3.5in) of water - over a month's average - was
dumped on the city late on Monday, officials say.</p>
            <p>The rain flooded some major roads and subway stations, causing
traffic chaos.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of passengers were stranded for several hours on a
flooded commuter train and had to be evacuated on police boats.</p>
            <p>Water levels on the rush-hour Richmond Hill train rose so high
that passengers fled to the upper decks of the coaches.</p>
            <p>The commuters had to be rescued by police and firefighters in
small inflatable boats.</p>
            <p>Emergency officials said five or six people were treated at the
scene for minor injuries.</p>
            <p>At the height of the outages, about
300,000 people were without power, utility company Toronto Hydro
said.</p>
            <p>The power company brought outages down to 20,000 early on
Tuesday, but an additional 30,000 lost power over the course of the
morning.</p>
            <p>Utility officials asked residents to limit their use of
electricity as the system was under extreme strain.</p>
            <p>Many basements and swimming pools in the area have been flooded
with sewage and some roads remain underwater.</p>
            <p>Porter Airlines cancelled all flights out of the downtown
airport on Monday because of the extreme weather.</p>
            <p>While the city saw about 90mm of rain, 126mm fell at nearby
Pearson International airport on Monday evening, breaking the daily
record of 121mm set by Hurricane Hazel in 1954.</p>
            <p>Average rainfall for the entire month of July in the area is 71
mm.</p>
            <p>Transit rail services were suspended in one area where a station
and tracks were still underwater.</p>
            <p>Toronto Mayor Rob Ford told reporters in a press conference on
Tuesday he was generally satisfied with response efforts from
emergency and city officials, but would order a full review to see
what more could have been done.</p>
            <p>"Toronto has persevered," Mr Ford was quoted by the CBC as
saying, calling the rain "unprecedented".</p>
            <p>"This is crucial that we all reduce our electricity for today to
help relieve the strain on our hydro system. We're hanging on by a
thread right now."</p>
            <p>The area is under threat of another thunderstorm this evening,

Environment Canada</a>.</p>
