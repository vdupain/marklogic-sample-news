            <p class="introduction">French aid worker
and amateur photographer Pierre Borghi spent four months in
shackles, imprisoned by the Taliban in a hole in the ground. But an
opportunity to escape eventually came his way, thanks in part to
the weight he had lost on the "Taliban diet".</p>
            <p>I was abducted by the Taliban on the evening of Tuesday 27
November.</p>
            <p>It had been an ordinary, relaxed day in Kabul - no bombs or
gunfire or stress. I had been to the supermarket, bought Chinese
noodles for dinner and planned a quiet night in watching a zombie
movie.</p>
            <p>This was my second week in Afghanistan on my second visit to the
country. I was looking for work in the humanitarian or urban
planning sectors while I tried to make it as a photographer.</p>
            <p>I was walking back from a bar, where I had been debating with
other freelancers and friends the safest way was to get around
Kabul. Security was on my mind, but the bar was in pretty much the
safest area in the city and I was staying a mere 500m away. I
didn't think being outside for five or 10 minutes would be such a
risk.</p>
            <p>That was a miscalculation.</p>
            <p>A white Toyota Corolla stopped just a few metres ahead of me.
Four guys got out, bearded, dressed in salwar kameez - the
traditional Afghan dress - and headed straight for me.</p>
            <div class="caption body-width">

                 alt="Cars driving through Kabul"/>
            </div>
            <p>They tried to grab me and take me to the car. When I fought
back, one of them took out a gun and told me to stop resisting. I
did.</p>
            <p>They shoved me into the middle of the back seat, squashing me
between their knees, and started driving. We went through all the
supposed safety checkpoints. After a while they pulled over,
blindfolded me, bound my hands behind my back and put me in the
boot of the car, along with one of the kidnappers.</p>
            <p>They made it clear that any attempt to make a noise or move
would be severely repressed.</p>
            <p>Scared as I was, I was switching to a
strange survival mode. It's a very conscious process. You start
thinking "Oh no - this is actually happening." And then you begin
to detach yourself from everything and you try not to panic and to
be as rational as possible.</p>
            <p>After another few hours of driving, they put me in the first of
the two holes in the ground I was to be kept in. It turned out to
be the nicer of the two - I had a bit of space and light.</p>
            <p>They said they were al-Qaeda, they were Taliban. They told me
that they had no problem with me personally, they had a problem
with my country. They said they had taken me because I was a
Westerner and my country was at war with Afghanistan.</p>
            <p>I was given a piece of paper to write down information about
myself, to be passed onto a Taliban "cabinet" for background
checking. They needed to check I wasn't a member of the special
forces or a spy or a diplomat - all of which would have meant my
immediate execution. After the background checks, this piece of
paper was to be passed to the French authorities as proof I was
alive.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, I managed to hang on to one sheet of paper and the
pen. I used it to write down a wish list for my life after I was
freed, which I kept throughout my detention.</p>
            <p>I also made a paper chessboard, and
killed time constructing chess problems.</p>
            <p>After about 10 days, they said they were going to take me to
Kabul and give me back my life.</p>
            <p>They got me out of the hole, bound my hands behind my back and
blindfolded me again. I was put on a motorbike. But instead of
taking me back to the city, I was taken down bumpy trails, over
rivers and into the mountains. I've had some interesting rides on
motorbikes before but never one like that.</p>
            <p>They were taking me to my next hole.</p>
            <p>But before that, I had 10 very strange
days living with an Afghan family, assisted by two Taliban fighters
who kept guard over me (these were new guards - I changed hands a
number of times throughout my incarceration).</p>
            <p>It was surreal - we ate together, slept together, watched videos
on their cellphone together. I even taught them some card games
that we played for hours and hours. It's utterly frustrating to
play cards with a guy that could put a bullet in your head at any
moment, especially when he is cheating.</p>
            <p>But the fighters either got tired of watching over me, or had to
go and fight in the mountains, or a trade agreement had been made
and they had to leave.</p>
            <p>So I was moved to a more convenient place for them to keep me -
a very small hole under a trapdoor in the floor of a barn, in which
I couldn't lay flat or sit up. I had one three-litre bucket to use
as a toilet. There was no light, none at all. I was kept there for
the next three-and-a-half months. I was only allowed out three or
four times, to shoot ransom videos. My hands and my feet were
chained together. The only sense of time passing came from the
occasional noise outside. A farmer chopping wood, a helicopter
flying overhead. But the Afghan winter is horribly silent.</p>
            <p>I was really bored. So what did I do?</p>
            <p>I mentally drafted thesis projects, books
and the blueprints for houses and towns (I was trained as an urban
planner).</p>
            <p>When I was hungry, I thought about food. I prepared dream
recipes that I am still planning to try out when I have some
friends over.</p>
            <p>I also started talking to myself and singing songs. I thought to
myself: "Don't worry, you're talking aloud, but you need it and are
conscious of it."</p>
            <p>I also talked to the people I loved - or imagined I talked to
them - and prayed a bit.</p>
            <p>You could say that I remained as French as I could - humour and
self-deprecation were key tools in keeping me sane.</p>
            <p>The chains restraining me were loose enough for me to get a foot
and a hand free. The trapdoor was not locked and I began to explore
the barn, sometimes spending whole hours - at night - out of the
hole. I started to nurture a hope that I might escape.</p>
            <p>But the Afghan winter is not only silent, it's also very cold.
My experience of the country told me that if I broke free at night
wearing the sandals and summer clothes I had been allowed to keep,
I would end up a frosted corpse.</p>
            <p>So I waited.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I had to do the videos, to prove I was alive. They told me what
to say. "Tell your country that you're sick, you're tired, you want
to go home. Tell them to give us what we want. Say hello and pass
on a message to your family and country and religion."</p>
            <p>For your family's sake, you try to keep yourself together, to be
positive, to be kind with your words, so they don't freak out.</p>
            <p>On the morning of 28 March, I was taken out of my hole, to shoot
another of these videos.</p>
            <p>In the space of 10 minutes, I was told I would be killed in the
next few days as France was not meeting the Taliban's demands. I
was given some letters my family had written and sent through the
secret services, and then put back in the hole.</p>
            <p>This was my very lowest point.</p>
            <p>In an attempt to remain rational, I calculated how long it would
take for this last video to be passed to the French authorities,
and for them to make a decision about the ransom demands. I spent
10 days in torment, trying to weigh the risk of staying against
that of escaping.</p>
            <p>Then I made up my mind. I thought I
couldn't afford to wait one more day - that at any moment, some
executioner would show up to cut away what was becoming an
embarrassing loose end for the Taliban.</p>
            <p>There was a tiny window in the barn, about 3m above the
ground.</p>
            <p>On the night of 7 April, I wrapped my chains - still attached to
one arm and one leg - in some rags to keep them quiet. Then I got
out of my hole and climbed up to the window on some discarded
furniture.</p>
            <p>Outside, I saw lights shimmering away on the right-hand side, in
the far distance. There's not much street lighting in Afghanistan,
so I figured this was a military base of some sort.</p>
            <p>I dropped some food, sugar and tea that I had saved over the
last few days through the window, and then tried to squeeze
through.</p>
            <p>When I reached my hips, I got stuck. I freaked out. But after a
few twists I fell in a heap on the outside. I would never have been
able to do that without the 25lb (11kg) I'd lost over the last four
months. You might call it the Taliban diet.</p>
            <p>I started walking towards the lights, stumbling and falling in
the freshly ploughed fields. I was talking to myself: "Ha, so you
like coming home stumbling at night? It's your time man, make this
the walk of your life!"</p>
            <p>I passed near some checkpoints on a nearby road. There was no
way of knowing if they were run by the army or the Taliban. So I
went down to a crawl, hiding behind rocks and pressing myself
against the hillside.</p>
            <p>Later on that night I found myself enmeshed in razor wire, and I
had to change direction when some dogs started to bark at me.</p>
            <p>I walked all night - eight, nine, 10 hours. By the early hours,
as the morning prayers echoed all around, my aching legs struggled
to keep moving, but I was getting closer to what seemed to be a
large city.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I reached a medium-height building, with an enclosed courtyard
and watchtowers. I went to the gate, and as I was looking puzzled
at the signs by the entrance, the military policeman on watch
shouted to me.</p>
            <p>"Kudja meri?" - Where are you going?</p>
            <p>"Inshallah be Kabul merim" - If God allows, I'm going to
Kabul.</p>
            <p>He pointed his AK-47 at me, not really knowing what to do with
this insane-looking guy in a salwar kameez with a huge beard, who
was pretending to be French and making wild claims about being
locked up by the Taliban in very sketchy Dari. So he called the
commandant, who called the general, who called interpreters, who
asked me questions. Another background check.</p>
            <p>A few hours later, I was taken to Kabul in a military convoy
with the general. While I was sitting in the car I thought about
how, at that very moment, my keepers would be coming to check on
me. I couldn't help smiling to myself as I thought of their faces
as they lifted the trap-door to my hole, which I had been so
careful to close again after I got out.</p>
            <p>It wasn't till the end of that day that I was handed over to the
French authorities in Kabul. They took me to the military hospital,
where the chief surgeon welcomed me with a nice big pair of bolt
cutters.</p>
            <p>My legs ached from the night-time walk that had followed such a
long period of inactivity, but physically and mentally I was in a
pretty good way. Everyone was surprised, including me.</p>
            <p>I took my first shower in 131 days and I was finally able to
call home.</p>
            <p>"Hi mum," I said. She said it was the happiest day of her life.
Very rarely had I cried during my time with the Taliban, but I did
cry when I made that call.</p>

            <p>I met French diplomats. We talked about
how they'd been dealing with my case, and what their plans had been
for me. I don't think they would ever have agreed to the ransom
demands.</p>
            <p>Today, I am back in Europe, trying to sort myself out. I still
have a sort of longing for Afghanistan - it's a love story between
me and that country and the people of that country. I will probably
go back in a few years - when things have calmed down a bit.</p>
            <p>Until then, my plan is to implement that wish list, starting
with learning how to play some decent tunes on the ukulele -
something I've wanted to do for years. It seems as good a place as
any to start enjoying my bonus life - my free life.</p>
