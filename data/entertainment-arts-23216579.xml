            <p class="introduction">Sir Michael
Parkinson has revealed that he has prostate cancer.</p>
            <p>The veteran broadcaster and former chat show host said he was
having radiotherapy and was confident of returning to full
health.</p>
            <p>"It was a great shock, but I have been told to expect to make a
full recovery," he said.</p>
            <p>Sir Michael, 78, known as Parky to his fans, was diagnosed with
the disease in May after a routine health check last year.</p>
            <p>"When you are told you have something like cancer, it is a
shock. But the cancer specialist said: 'I will assure you, you will
not die of this.'</p>
            <p>"I am concerned about it, of course, but I am not frightened of
it."</p>
            <p>Sir Michael said he continues to live "a normal life", aside
from the "distraction" of his five weekly sessions of
radiotherapy.</p>
            <p>Describing his treatment as "extraordinary", he said had not
felt any pain or discomfort.</p>
            <p>"If anything, it's boring," he said. "You have to lie there
completely still, for six minutes.</p>
            <p>"But I have had no side effects at all."</p>
            <p>Sir Michael admitted that the diagnosis was a shock, but said he
was "in wonder" at the "marvellous" work of medical staff and was
"very grateful".</p>
            <p>"When you get involved in this, you begin to understand the
extraordinary work of those involved in treating cancer," he
added.</p>
            <p>The journalist and renowned interviewer urged men to pay more
attention to their health and to take notice of any unusual
symptoms.</p>
            <p>"I don't want to trivialise it, but men know when there's a
problem. I have been lucky, but men are silly about their
health.</p>
            <p>"Get it checked out - it might be something else."</p>
            <p>Sir Michael, whose career spanned 50 years and saw him interview
high-profile guests such as Muhammad Ali, Sir Elton John and Rod
Hull with puppet Emu, announced his retirement in 2007.</p>
            <p>He said he had no intention of letting cancer get in the
way.</p>
            <p>"I'm 78 and I have had a good life," he said.</p>
            <p>"I shall be around for a while yet, to the delight of my friends
and the dismay of my enemies."</p>
