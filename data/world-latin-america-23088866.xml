               <span style="width:304px;">Vittorio Missoni and his wife, Maurizia
Castiglioni, were on board the plane</span>

            <p class="introduction">Officials in
Venezuela say they have found a plane that disappeared carrying the
boss of Italian fashion house Missoni in January.</p>
            <p>Vittorio Missoni, 58, and his wife were among six people on
board the flight from Los Roques islands to Caracas.</p>
            <p>Interior Ministry spokesman Jorge Galindo announced the
discovery of the plane on Twitter.</p>
            <p>Officials said it was found 70m (230ft) under water, north of
Los Roques islands in the Caribbean.</p>
            <p>Following the plane's disappearance on 4 January, investigators
from the Italian Agency for Air Safety (ANSV) said the company that
owned the small plane was not fully licensed to operate.</p>
            <p>A piece of luggage from the aircraft was found off the Dutch
island of Curacao, about 320km (200 miles) west of Los Roques,
later that month.</p>

            <p>Mr Missoni was the son of the fashion brand's founder, Ottavio
Missoni, and co-owned the firm with his siblings.</p>
            <p>He was returning from a Christmas and New Year holiday with his
wife, Maurizia Castiglioni, and two friends - Elda Scalvenzi and
Guido Foresti.</p>
            <p>Two Venezuelan pilots were also on board the plane.</p>
            <p>Minutes after take-off, one of the pilots reported that the
plane was at 5,000ft (1,524m) and 10 nautical miles from Los Roques
airport, Italy's air safety agency has said.</p>
            <p>The last radar report showed the aircraft accelerating at
5,400ft (1,645m) before it rapidly lost altitude and speed, veering
to the right until it disappeared from the radar.</p>
