            <p class="introduction">Cyprus President
Nicos Anastasiades has urged eurozone leaders to revise the terms
of his country's bank bailout, in a highly critical letter.</p>
            <p>He said the "haircut" imposed on large deposits under the
10bn-euro (Ã‚Â£8.6bn) bailout had
significantly eroded the capital kept by businesses in banks.</p>
            <p>Losses were imposed on big deposits in Bank of Cyprus (BoC) and
Laiki Bank. BoC is now in trouble, the letter said.</p>
            <p>The letter to Cyprus's creditors, sent last week, was leaked on
Wednesday.</p>
            <p>"I urge you to support a long-term solution to Bank of Cyprus'
thin liquidity position," Mr Anastasiades said.</p>
            <p>Laiki Bank is being wound up and its safe assets transferred to
BoC.</p>
            <p>For large depositors at both banks the first 100,000 euros is
protected, but the government can tap up to 40% of their remaining
deposits, to contribute billions towards the bailout.</p>
            <p>But Mr Anastasiades complained that "no distinction was made
between long-term deposits earning high returns and money flowing
through current accounts, such as firms' working capital". "This
amounted to a significant loss of working capital for
businesses."</p>
            <p>The rescue was agreed in March with the troika of international
lenders - the European Commission, European Central Bank and
International Monetary Fund.</p>
            <p>Capital restrictions imposed to prevent a run on Cypriot banks
have been eased, but remain in place. The president said such
"artificial" measures "will only aggravate the depositors the
longer they persist".</p>
            <p>"Rather than creating confidence in the banking system they are
eroding it by the day," he warned.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://openeuropeblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/full-letter-from-cypriot-president-to.html"
               title="Text of Anastasiades letter - from Open Europe blog">text of
his letter</a> appeared on the Open Europe think tank's blog on
Wednesday. His complaints about the bailout were also reported by
the Financial Times.</p>
            <p>Unnamed eurozone officials quoted by Reuters news agency say
there are no plans to alter the terms of the bailout for Cyprus or
to supply more funds.</p>
            <p>Eurozone finance ministers will discuss the letter at a meeting
in Luxembourg on Thursday, Reuters reports.</p>
            <p>Cyprus has started receiving instalments of the bailout package
from international creditors.</p>
