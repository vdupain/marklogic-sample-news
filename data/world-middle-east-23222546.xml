plunging into a cycle of violence"</p>

            <p class="introduction">At least 40 people
have been killed in a shooting incident in Cairo, amid ongoing
unrest over the removal of Egypt's President Mohammed Morsi.</p>
            <p>The Muslim Brotherhood says its members were fired on at a
barracks where they believe Mr Morsi is being held, during a sit-in
demanding his reinstatement.</p>
            <p>However the army said a "terrorist group" had tried to storm the
barracks.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi, an Islamist and Egypt's first freely elected leader,
was ousted by the army last week after mass protests.</p>
            <p>Scores of people have been killed since the unrest began at the
end of last month.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi is believed to be detained at the Presidential Guard
Club, in the eastern Nasr City district of the capital.</p>
            <p>His supporters - many of them members of
Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood movement - have been staging a sit-in
there. They say the army has mounted a coup and that Mr Morsi is
the legitimate president.</p>
            <p>After Monday morning's violence, the hardline Salafist Nour
party - which had supported Mr Morsi's removal - said it was
withdrawing from talks to choose an interim prime minister,
describing the shooting incident as a "massacre".</p>
            <p>The Egyptian health ministry said at least 40 people had been
killed, including an army officer, while the Brotherhood put the
number of dead at 53, and said children were among the victims.</p>
            <p>Some 300 people were reported wounded.</p>
            <p>TV channels broadcast images of dead and injured people being
taken to a makeshift hospital in the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque, where
Brotherhood supporters have been based.</p>

my face"</p>
            </div>
            <p>But there were conflicting reports over how the violence
unfolded.</p>
            <p>The Muslim Brotherhood said the army had raided its sit-in at
about 04:00 (02:00 GMT) as protesters were performing dawn
prayers.</p>
            <p>"The protesters were taken unawares and the troops used live
ammunition, bird shot and tear gas," protester Alaa el-Hadidi told
the BBC.</p>
            <p>Another protester, Mahmud al-Shilli, told AFP news agency that
troops had used tear gas but that a group of men in civilian
clothing had then opened fire.</p>
            <p>"The thugs came from the side. We were the target," he told
AFP.</p>
            <p>The Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), the Brotherhood's political
wing - which took nearly half the seats in last year's historic
election - called on Egyptians to stage an "uprising" in response
to the incident, against "those trying to steal their revolution
with tanks".</p>
            <p>It also urged "the international community and international
groups and all the free people of the world to intervene to stop
further massacres" and to stop Egypt becoming "a new Syria".</p>
            <p>But in a statement read on state media, the army blamed the
shooting on "an armed terrorist group" that had tried to storm the
barracks.</p>
            <p>It said an army officer was among those
killed and that a number of others were wounded, some
critically.</p>
            <p>The statement said some 200 people had been arrested and were
found to have weapons, ammunition and petrol bombs.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors have also ordered the closure of the FJP
headquarters in Cairo, after police said weapons had been found
inside.</p>
            <p>The army later said two soldiers had been briefly kidnapped by
Morsi supporters.</p>
            <p>It said that in two separate instances men armed with guns and
knives had forced the soldiers into vehicles and made them repeat
pro-Morsi statements, filming one of them doing so.</p>
            <p>The soldiers managed to escape, said the Mena news agency.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi was ousted on Wednesday by the military, which said it
was responding to the demands of the people.</p>
            <p>Protesters had been demanding that Mr
Morsi step down, saying he had failed to tackle Egypt's economic
problems and was becoming increasingly authoritarian.</p>
            <p>He was replaced on Thursday by Adly Mansour - the head of the
Supreme Constitutional Court. Mr Mansour has pledged to hold
elections soon, but as yet has given no date for them.</p>
            <p>The army has insisted it does not want to remain in power.</p>
            <p>On Sunday, tens of thousands of both supporters and opponents of
Mr Morsi rallied in many Egyptian cities.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Jim Muir in Cairo says that despite the conflicting
reports about Monday's violence, it is clear that blood has been
shed, which will aggravate an already critical situation.</p>
            <p>The withdrawal of the ultra-conservative Nour party from the
political transition talks will also set back efforts to appoint a
new prime minister, our correspondent adds.</p>
            <p>Party spokesman Nadder Bakkar said it had "decided to withdraw
immediately from all negotiations in response to the massacre".</p>
            <p>Though the Islamist party had backed the army-led "roadmap" to
new elections, it had blocked the appointment of two potential
prime ministers because of concerns over the shape of a new
constitution.</p>
            <p>One of those rejected by Nour, leading opposition figure Mohamed
ElBaradei, condemned the violence and called for an "immediate
independent and transparent investigation", saying Egypt was "in
dire need of reconciliation".</p>

            <p>There was a sombre mood in Cairo as people woke up to the news
of killing and bloodshed.</p>
            <p>Eyewitness accounts of what happened outside the Presidential
Guards Club have inflamed the already simmering tensions. For
Egyptians, it is shocking news no matter who started the
gunfight.</p>
            <p>The deadly incident is not the first. On Friday, three
protesters were killed at the same spot in unclear circumstances
but against a backdrop of a stand-off between the army and the
pro-Morsi protesters.</p>
            <p>The latest shooting is likely to lead to a political breakdown
as the Islamist Nour party, the largest Salafist group, withdrew
from marathon talks with interim president Adly Mansour to form a
caretaker government.</p>
