to improve further in the current quarter</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Japanese
manufacturers' sentiment has turned positive for the first time in
nearly two years, the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey has
indicated.</p>
            <p>The big manufacturers' index rose to plus 4 in the April-to-June
period, from minus 8 in the previous quarter.</p>
            <p>Large manufacturers also plan to boost their capital spending in
the current financial year, the survey showed.</p>
            <p>Japan has unveiled aggressive policy moves in recent months to
try to spur growth in its stagnant economy.</p>
            <p>Analysts said the survey's results indicated that the policies
were starting to have an impact.</p>
            <p>"The Tankan confirmed that expectations among big Japanese
manufacturers for a weaker yen and a steady economic recovery more
than offset recent market turmoil," said Takeshi Minami, chief
economist as Norinchukin Research Institute, in Tokyo.</p>
            <p>"Industrial output is rising slowly, exports are recovering
gradually, public works are expected to come out more strongly and
next year's sales tax hike will prompt a last-minute buying rush
later this year.</p>
            <p>"All of these positive factors, together with the effects of
'Abenomics', are encouraging to Japanese firms."</p>
            <p>Among the measures that the Japanese policymakers have taken
over the past few months has been the decision by the central bank
to double its inflation target to 2%.</p>

            <p>Unlike many other countries in the
region, Japan has been battling falling consumer prices, or
deflation, for best part of the past two decades.</p>
            <p>That has hurt domestic consumption as business and consumers
tend to put off purchases in the hope of getting a better deal
later on.</p>
            <p>In an attempt to fight deflation and to boost overall economy,
the Bank of Japan has doubled the country's money supply.</p>
            <p>The idea is that with with more money being pumped into the
system, coupled with low interest rates, businesses and consumers
will have more cash to spend and that will help spur demand as well
as prices.</p>
            <p>The moves have had a significant impact on the Japanese
currency. The yen has dipped nearly 25% against the US dollar since
November last year.</p>
            <p>Analysts said that the weakness in the yen was one of the key
factors in boosting manufacturers' sentiment, especially that of
the exporters, as it makes their goods more affordable for foreign
buyers.</p>
            <p>A weak yen also boosts their earnings when they repatriate their
foreign earnings back home.</p>
            <p>"The improvement in big firms' sentiment was largely driven by
yen weakness, which supported exports, and the recovering economy
overall," said Taro Saito, director of economic research as NLI
Research Institute.</p>
            <p>"Big manufacturers' assumed yen rate against the dollar for this
fiscal year is still stronger than the market rate, so there is a
chance that their profit forecast for this fiscal year will be
upgraded."</p>
            <p>The latest survey suggests companies are planning to boost
levels of investment in the current financial year.</p>
            <p>Some analysts said that companies were likely to have more cash
to spend as they see profits rise.</p>
            <p>Martin Schulz from Fujitsu Research Institute said increased
investment from big firms was likely to further assist the revival
of the Japanese economy.</p>
            <p>"Right now the economy is boosted by a weak yen and hopes of a
growth-boost," Mr Schulz told the BBC.</p>
            <p>"But once companies start to spend, that is when you see a real
impact on the economy."</p>
            <p>He said increased investment not only created jobs, but also saw
salaries rise, giving more spending power to consumers.</p>
            <p>"That helps the recovery process tremendously," he said.</p>
