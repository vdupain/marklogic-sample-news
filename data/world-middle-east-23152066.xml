violence for several years</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">At least 40 people
have been killed in a wave of bomb attacks across Iraq - most of
them in the capital Baghdad.</p>
            <p>Busy Shia market areas in the capital were the main targets. In
the most serious attack, nine people died when two car bombs went
off in the northern Shaab district.</p>
            <p>Iraq is suffering its worst sectarian violence since 2008.</p>
            <p>The UN released figures on Monday indicating that over 2,500
Iraqis have died in violent attacks since April.</p>
            <p>More than 30 people were killed in Baghdad alone on Tuesday,
with several car bombs ripping through markets and commercial
areas.</p>
            <p>Car bombs also went off in the predominantly Shia cities of
Basra, Amara and Samawa, killing three people and injuring 50, the
AFP news agency reports.</p>
            <p>Four people reportedly died after a suicide bomber blew himself
up inside a tent where a funeral was taking place in the city of
Baquba, north-east of Baghdad - a day after a car bomb destroyed a
coffee shop there, killing 10 people.</p>
            <p>The recent surge in violence comes amid heightened tensions
between Iraq's Sunni and Shia communities, amid claims by the
Sunnis that they are being marginalised by Prime Minister Nouri
Maliki's Shia-led government.</p>
            <p>Violence erupted in April when Iraqi security forces stormed an
anti-government Sunni protest in the city of Hawija, killing and
wounding dozens of protesters.</p>
