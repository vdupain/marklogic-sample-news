            <p class="introduction">At least 17 people
including women and children have been killed by a roadside bomb in
in western Afghanistan, officials have told the BBC.</p>
            <p>Ten of the dead were members of the same family, police
said.</p>
            <p>Police told the AP news agency that the bomb in Herat province
had been placed near a trailer being pulled by a motorcycle to
transport civilians.</p>
            <p>They said the Taliban had apparently planted the bomb in an
attempt to kill Afghan troops.</p>
            <p>Instead, the device went off next to the makeshift vehicle.</p>
            <p>Police say that those killed were travelling from their village
in Obe district to a local town when it hit the improvised
explosive device (IED).</p>
            <p>Twelve of the dead were women and four were children, officials
said.</p>
            <p>The attack is being blamed on the Taliban, who are yet to
comment on the bombing.</p>
            <p>IEDs have increasingly been used by the Taliban over the past
two years in Afghanistan and have killed hundreds of people.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Bilal Sarwary in Kabul says that in addition they have
stifled the economy and created a climate of fear - and their
capacity to wreak destruction and havoc appears to be
increasing.</p>
            <p>Our correspondent says the exact number of people killed by such
bombs is difficult to calculate, but officials say they were behind
the deaths of most of the of 1,800 police and 900 army personnel
killed last year.</p>
            <p>Ten civilians including eight women were killed in a similar
attack in the southern province of Kandahar last week.</p>
            <p>In consecutive weeks in November, at least 37 people were killed
in separate roadside bombings of wedding parties.</p>
