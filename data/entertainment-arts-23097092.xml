            <p class="introduction">Famed US
photographer, Bert Stern, best known for his images of Marilyn
Monroe in what became known as The Last Sitting, has died at the
age of 83.</p>
            <p>Film-maker Shannah Laumeister, 43, who said the two were
secretly married in 2009, confirmed he died at his home in New York
on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>Stern photographed Monroe for Vogue magazine, just weeks before
she died from a drug overdose in 1962.</p>
            <p>Other celebrities he photographed included Audrey Hepburn and
Twiggy.</p>
            <p>Laumeister said: "He'll be remembered as someone who loved women
and loved taking pictures and putting things he felt strongly about
in the camera.</p>
            <p>"His images will live forever and wow generations to come," she
said, adding that the Monroe images "go beyond the photograph and
become a work of art".</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">In 1981, John Vassos (r) returned
missing pictures of Monroe to Stern, which the photographer
believed to be stolen</span>
            </div>
            <p>Stern took more than 2,500 photographs of Monroe during the
intimate three-day shoot at the Bel Air Hotel in Los Angeles, six
weeks before her death in 1962.</p>
            <p>The nude and semi-nude images - including several which Monroe
rejected for magazine publication - were published in a 1982 book
titled The Last Sitting, and a second book, Marilyn Monroe: The
Complete Last Sitting, that came out in 2000.</p>
            <p>In a documentary about the photographer made by Laumeister,
Stern said: "It was a one-time-in-a-lifetime experience to have
Marilyn Monroe in a hotel room, even though it was turned into a
studio."</p>
            <p>A collection of 36 photographs taken during The Last Sitting
were auctioned in New York for nearly $150,000
(Ã‚Â£102,581) in 2008.</p>
            <p>Born in Brooklyn, Stern photographed a host of celebrities such
as such as Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor and Truman Capote during
a career that spanned 50 years.</p>
            <p>He was also highly regarded as an advertising photographer,
launching his career with a campaign for Smirnoff Vodka.</p>
            <p>The image showed a V-shaped glass of vodka set in the front of
an Egyptian pyramid.</p>
            <p>Along with contemporaries Irving Penn and Richard Avedon, he is
credited with transforming commercial photographs into conceptual
art. He also took the publicity shots for Stanley Kubrick's 1962
drama, Lolita.</p>
            <p>Bruce Barnes, director of the George Eastman House, a museum of
photography and film in Rochester, New York, said: "He was an
enormously innovative photographer, both as a commercial
photographer and a photographer of celebrities and fashion models.
And one of the great people in his field."</p>
            <p>The museum is preparing to present Stern's only documentary
film, Jazz on a Summer's Day, which he made in the late 1950s,
about the Newport Jazz Festival.</p>
            <p>Stern and Laumeister had been scheduled to attend a screening of
Laumeister's documentary in August, Barnes said.</p>
            <p>Stern's funeral is due to take place in New York on Friday.</p>
