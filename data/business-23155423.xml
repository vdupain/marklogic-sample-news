(Ã‚Â£5.2bn) to cover the likely compensation
bill for civil claims</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A former FBI chief
will probe alleged misconduct over payments to settle claims for
the BP Gulf oil spill.</p>
            <p>Louis Freeh was appointed by Judge Carl Barbier, who is hearing
civil cases over the disaster in 2010.</p>
            <p>BP, which has warned that the compensation system is being
abused, welcomed the appointment.</p>
            <p>It hoped Mr Freeh would lead a "thorough investigation into the
recent allegations of unethical and potentially criminal
behaviour".</p>
            <p>The explosion of the oil rig killed 11 workers and released an
estimated four million barrels of oil into the Gulf and along the
coastline.</p>
            <p>BP put aside $7.8bn (Ã‚Â£5.2bn) when it
agreed to pay compensation in 2012, but the company has become
increasingly concerned that the final figure would be much
higher.</p>
            <p>Judge Barbier said on Tuesday: "The court has concluded that in
order to ensure the integrity of the program for the benefit of the
parties and the public, an independent, external investigation of
this matter should be performed."</p>
            <p>BP said in its statement that Mr Freeh had been granted "wide
latitude" to look for other possible misconduct within the Court
Supervised Settlement Program.</p>
            <p>BP has no control over its payments to claimants, having agreed
to a compensation formula and framework in a legal settlement
covering certain personal and business liabilities.</p>
            <p>Mr Freeh was a federal judge in New York before serving as FBI
director from 1993 to 2001. He founded his consulting firm, Freeh
Group International Solutions, in 2007.</p>
            <p>After being appointed on Tuesday, he met with Judge Barbier, BP
representatives and top plaintiff attorneys.</p>
