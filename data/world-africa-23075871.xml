court in support of Amina Tyler on 29 May</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A court in Tunisia
has freed three European feminists jailed for staging a topless
protest, their lawyer has said.</p>
            <p>Bahri Souhaib said their sentences had been suspended, and that
they would leave Tunisia as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>The members of the activist group Femen - two French and one
German - were arrested outside a courtroom in Tunis.</p>
            <p>They were sentenced to four months and one day in prison after
being convicted of public indecency, in a protest in support of a
Tunisian activist.</p>
            <p>They were also convicted of offending public morals and
threatening public order.</p>
            <p>The women - Pauline Hillier, Marguerite Stern and Josephine
Markmann - argued that there had been nothing sexual or offensive
about their protest, the first of its kind seen in the Arab
world.</p>
            <p>Instead, they maintained that they were
fighting "for the rights of women wherever they are threatened" and
had sought to demand the release of fellow activist Amina Tyler, a
Tunisian.</p>
            <p>"I didn't think it was going to shock Tunisians to that extent.
Given the consequences, I would never do it again. We want to
return to our country and our loved ones,'' Ms Hillier told the
court on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>Ms Tyler was detained in May after reportedly writing "Femen" on
a wall in the religious centre of Kairouan. She also outraged some
Tunisians in March by posting photos online of herself topless with
the slogan "My body is my own" written on her torso. She remains in
detention, awaiting trial.</p>
            <p>Femen describes itself as "fighting patriarchy in its three
manifestations - sexual exploitation of women, dictatorship and
religion".</p>
            <p>Its action in Tunisia is set against the background of tensions
following the overthrow of the secular regime of long-serving
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.</p>
            <p>A moderate Islamist-led government has since won democratic
elections. There has also been an increase in the prominence of
ultra-conservative Islamists known as Salafists, who want greater
public piety in Tunisia.</p>
