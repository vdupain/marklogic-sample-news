each other of using chemical weapons</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Russia says it has
evidence showing a projectile that hit a northern Syrian village
contained the nerve agent sarin and was most likely fired by
rebels.</p>
            <p>Moscow's permanent representative to the UN told reporters that
the findings were the result of an independent investigation
requested by Damascus.</p>
            <p>Both sides have accused each other of attacks involving chemical
weapons.</p>
            <p>The incident in Khan al-Assal, outside Aleppo, on 19 March left
at least 27 people dead and dozens injured.</p>
            <p>Last month, the UN Human Rights Council's Independent
International Commission of Inquiry said there were reasonable
grounds to believe that "limited quantities of toxic chemicals" had
been used at Khan al-Assal, as well as in three other attacks.</p>
            <p>But it had "not been possible... to
determine the precise chemical agents used, their delivery systems
or the perpetrator", it added.</p>
            <p>The inquiry also called on the Syrian authorities to allow a
team of UN chemical weapons experts into the country - a request
Damascus has so far refused because of disputes over access to
areas that the UK and French governments also want
investigated.</p>
            <p>On Monday, Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin,
revealed that its Syrian ally had asked Russian experts to look
into the Khan al-Assal attack.</p>
            <p>They had visited the location where the projectile landed and
taken their own samples, which were then analysed at a Russian
laboratory certified by the Organisation for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW), Mr Churkin said.</p>
            <p>The chemical agent was carried by a "Bashair-3 unguided
projectile", which was produced by the Bashair al-Nasr Brigade, a
rebel group affiliated with the Free Syrian Army, he alleged.</p>
            <p>"The results of the analysis clearly
indicate that the ordnance used in Khan al-Assal was not
industrially manufactured and was filled with sarin."</p>
            <p>"The projectile involved is not a standard one for chemical
use," Mr Churkin added. "Hexogen, utilised as an opening charge, is
not utilised in standard ammunitions. Therefore, there is every
reason to believe that it was armed opposition fighters who used
the chemical weapons in Khan al-Assal."</p>
            <p>Mr Churkin said the report had been submitted to UN Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon, whose spokesman said he took "seriously all
credible allegations".</p>
            <p>The UK and France sent letters to the secretary general in late
March which reportedly detailed evidence based on witness
interviews and soil samples that chemical weapons had been used on
multiple occasions, including at Khan al-Assal.</p>
            <p>In mid-June, the US said its intelligence agencies believed
government forces had used chemical weapons, including sarin, "on a
small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last
year", resulting in an estimated 100-150 deaths.</p>
            <p>Following Mr Churkin's announcement, a UK government spokesman
told the BBC: "We will examine whatever is presented to us, but to
date we have seen no credible reporting of chemical weapons use by
the Syrian opposition, or that the opposition have obtained
chemical weapons."</p>
            <p>White House spokesman Jay Carney said the US had also "yet to
see any evidence that backs up the assertion that anybody besides
the Syrian government has the ability to use chemical weapons, [or]
has used chemical weapons".</p>
            <p>"Our ability as an international community to investigate the
use of chemical weapons in Syria is hampered by Assad's refusal to
allow a United Nations investigation."</p>
            <p>Sarin is considered 20 times as deadly as cyanide and is
impossible to detect due to its odourless, tasteless and colourless
properties. The agent attacks the nervous system, often causing
respiratory failure and can cause death within minutes of
exposure.</p>
