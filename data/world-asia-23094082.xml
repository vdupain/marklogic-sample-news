               <p class="caption">The Bangladeshi government has branded the
decision "shocking", "harsh" and "disappointing", as Mahfuz Sadique
reports from Dhaka.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Bangladesh has
criticised Washington's decision to suspend trade privileges over
concerns about dangerous working conditions and labour rights.</p>
            <p>This decision comes after a year-long review of labour practices
and workplace safety in Bangladesh.</p>
            <p>The foreign ministry in Dhaka described the move as harsh,
saying the government had taken clear measures to improve safety at
clothing factories.</p>
            <p>In April, 1,127 died when when a factory building collapsed near
Dhaka.</p>
            <p>The eight-storey Rana Plaza building came crashing down on 24
April, a day after cracks had been spotted in the building.</p>
            <p>It was the deadliest in a series of accidents that have focused
global attention on safety standards in Bangladesh's export garment
industry, which is the second biggest in the world after
China's.</p>
            <p>The disaster sparked a series of angry protests by workers in
the garment industry and heightened international concern. Twelve
people have so far been arrested, including the building's
owner.</p>
            <p>It also prompted the government to introduce some reforms and
more inspections and some international retailers have also
proposed an accord to improve safety conditions in Bangladesh.</p>
            <p>But unions and experts say hundreds of
factories are still operating in shoddy buildings, raising fears
that another tragedy could occur at any time.</p>
            <p>The US order suspends Bangladesh's duty-free trade privileges
under the terms of a trade programme called the Generalized System
of Preferences (GSP), designed to promote economic growth in
developing countries.</p>
            <p>"It cannot be more shocking for the factory workers of
Bangladesh that the decision to suspend GSP comes at a time when
the government of Bangladesh has taken concrete and visible
measures to improve factory safety and protect workers' rights," a
Bangladesh foreign ministry statement said.</p>
            <p>But President Barack Obama, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/27/technical-trade-proclamation-congress-regarding-bangladesh">
in a proclamation</a>, said Bangladesh was not taking steps to
afford internationally recognised rights to its workers.</p>
            <p>And US Trade Representative Michael Froman said several recent
incidents "had served to highlight some of the serious shortcomings
in worker rights and workplace safety standards in Bangladesh".</p>
            <p>The BBC's Mahfuz Sadique in Dhaka says that Thursday's decision,
which comes into effect in 60 days, is mostly symbolic as it covers
less than 1% of Bangladesh's nearly $5bn
(Ã‚Â£3.2bn) exports to the US and it does not
affect clothing exports.</p>
            <p>But, our correspondent says, it could have an influence over the
European Union's review into similar privileges.</p>
            <p>The EU is the largest market for garments from Bangladesh,
accounting for 60% of exports. The garment industry employs some
four million people in Bangladesh, 80% of them women.</p>
