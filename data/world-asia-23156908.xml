to tackle corruption</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">China has sacked a
top regional party official for suspected "disciplinary
violations", state media report.</p>
            <p>Wang Suyi was formerly head of Inner Mongolia's United Front
Work Department.</p>
            <p>The Communist Party's Organisational Department, which is
responsible for staffing, confirmed his dismissal on Wednesday,
Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
            <p>He appears to be the latest in a series of senior officials who
have fallen victim to a crackdown on corruption.</p>
            <p>Tackling corruption has been President Xi Jinping's most
high-profile policy since he became China's leader.</p>
            <p>He has warned that "corruption and bribe-taking by some party
members and cadres" pose "severe challenges" to the Communist
Party's rule.</p>
            <p>Mr Wang is suspected of serious disciplinary violations,
state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing a Communist Party
official.</p>
            <p>The report gave no further details but the term "serious
disciplinary violations" is often used to refer to suspected
corruption in Chinese reports.</p>
            <p>Chinese media have also cited unverified reports that said Mr
Wang's mistresses had reported him for corruption of close to 100m
yuan ($16.3m; Ã‚Â£10.7m) and nepotism.</p>
            <p>In recent months, several senior or high-profile officials have
been investigated.</p>
            <p>Last month, Lei Zhengfu, a former official at the centre of a
sex tape extortion scandal, was jailed for accepting bribes.</p>
            <p>China's former railways minister, Liu Zhijun, was also put on
trial for corruption and abuse of state power.</p>
            <p>In May, China announced that it was investigating Liu Tienan,
formerly the top official at the body responsible for planning
China's economy, for "serious disciplinary violations".</p>
            <p>Allegations against Mr Liu first surfaced in December, after an
investigative journalist alleged that he made questionable
financial deals, fabricated his academic record and threatened to
kill a former mistress.</p>
