               <span style="width:304px;">Sales of the Nook e-reader have struggled and it has
had to cut prices</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The chief executive
of US bookstore chain Barnes &amp; Noble, William Lynch, has
resigned amid a continued drop in sales of its Nook e-books and
devices.</p>
            <p>His resignation comes just days after the firm reported that
sales in the Nook business fell 34% in the fourth quarter, from a
year earlier.</p>
            <p>That saw its overall losses more than double to $118.6m
(Ã‚Â£77m) in the period.</p>
            <p>The Nook e-reader was launched in 2009, but has failed to take
on the Amazon Kindle in the growing e-books market.</p>
            <p>"Lynch was highly instrumental in making Nook a centrepiece in
Barnes &amp; Noble's broader operational strategy," said Alan
Rifkin, an analyst at Barclays.</p>
            <p>"With this announcement, Barnes &amp; Noble is, in our view,
signalling that it is attempting to reduce its dependence upon the
Nook."</p>
            <p>The decline in sales of the Nook business has raised concerns
over the future of the division and the direction that the firm may
take going forward.</p>
            <p>While reporting its latest earnings last
month, the company said that it plans to reduce losses in the
segment by "limiting risks associated with manufacturing".</p>
            <p>It said that while it will continue to develop its e-readers
in-house, its tablet line will be produced and marketed with a
consumer electronics manufacturer. But it did not identify the
manufacturer.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, there have also been reports that Microsoft, which
already owns 17% of Nook Media, was planning to buy the division
outright.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, Leonard Riggio, the company's founder,
chairman and largest shareholder, said he wanted to buy back the
company's retail operations, but not its Nook e-reader.</p>
            <p>Analysts said that whatever decision Mr Riggio takes about
buying back the retail operations will be key to shaping the firm's
future.</p>
            <p>"The next step is Chairman Leonard Riggio deciding if he's going
to bid to buy the retail division and from that they'll then decide
what to do with the Nook," said John Tinker a media analyst with
Maxim Group.</p>
            <p>"Do they close it down? Do they reintegrate it back in the
company? What happens to minority investors, Microsoft and
Pearson?</p>
            <p>"It all can be driven by the Chairman," he added.</p>
