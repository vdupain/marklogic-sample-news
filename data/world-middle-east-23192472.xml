            <p class="introduction">Supporters of
Egypt's ousted president are gathering for protests in the capital
to demand his reinstatement.</p>
            <p>The army, which removed Mr Morsi and detained him in response to
widespread unrest, has said it will allowed peaceful protests.</p>
            <p>Adly Mahmud Mansour, the top judge of the constitutional court,
is now Egypt's interim leader and has promised that elections will
take place soon.</p>
            <p>The African Union has announced it will suspend Egypt from all
activities.</p>
            <p>Admore Kambudzi, secretary of the body's Peace and Security
Council, said the move was being taken in line with AU policy
"until the restoration of constitutional order".</p>
            <p>The removal of Mr Morsi by the army
followed days of mass protests, largely organised by the Tamarod
[Rebel] movement.</p>
            <p>The protesters accused Mr Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood - the
Islamist group of which he is a member - of pursuing an Islamist
agenda against the wishes of the majority, and of failing to tackle
economic problems.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected leader, is in detention,
as are senior figures in the Brotherhood. Arrests warrants have
been issued for some 300 others.</p>

            <p>The army command has said it will not take "arbitrary measures
against any faction or political current" and would guarantee the
right to protest, as long as demonstrations did not threaten
national security.</p>
            <p>"Peaceful protest and freedom of expression are rights
guaranteed to everyone, which Egyptians have earned as one of the
most important gains of their glorious revolution," it said.</p>
            <p>But Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad al-Haddad said the
movement was refusing to co-operate with the new leadership and
demanded the immediate release of those detained.</p>
            <p>At his news conference on Thursday, he said the Brotherhood
would take part in "peaceful, people-led protest".</p>
            <p>Mohamed Soudan, foreign relations secretary for the
Brotherhood-affiliated Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), said the
army action and the arrests were moving Egypt "back to the
dictatorship regime".</p>
            <p>Thousands of Brotherhood supporters have
been camped outside Cairo's Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque, vowing to
stage a "Day of Rejection".</p>
            <p>"We came from all of Egypt for one goal only, to return the
democratically elected president to the palace," said one man.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Rana Jawad in Cairo says some have been calling for
the execution of Gen Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief who
announced the ousting of Mr Morsi.</p>
            <p>Tanks and military personnel have been deployed to potential
flashpoints in the capital and the mood is tense, says our
correspondent.</p>
            <p>On Friday, troops were deployed in Mr Morsi's hometown of
Zagazig, in Shariqiya province, after rival protesters clashed. The
health ministry said 80 people had been injured.</p>
            <p>Some 50 people have died since the latest unrest began on
Sunday.</p>
            <p>Mohamed ElBaradei - a leading opposition figure who backed the
overthrow of Mr Morsi - said the army's intervention had been
"painful" but was on behalf of the people and ultimately averted
civil war.</p>
            <p>"Mr Morsi unfortunately undermined his own legitimacy," he told
the BBC.</p>
            <p>He said elections would be held within a year at the most as the
army had no intention of ruling.</p>
            <p>He had urged the military to treat Mr Morsi with "full dignity
as a former president", he said, and hoped detained Muslim
Brotherhood members would be released.</p>
            <p>Mr Mansour was sworn in as interim head
of state on Thursday, vowing to safeguard "the spirit of the
revolution" which had removed Hosni Mubarak from power in 2011.</p>
            <p>He has invited the Brotherhood "to participate in building the
nation".</p>
            <p>The army's roadmap for the post-Morsi era includes:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Suspension of the constitution</li>
               <li>A civilian, transitional technocratic government</li>
               <li>Supreme constitutional court to prepare for presidential and
parliamentary elections</li>
               <li>A "charter of honour" to be drawn up and followed by national
media</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Early on Friday, one soldier was reported killed after Islamist
militants attacked military and police checkpoints in the Sinai
Peninsula with rockets and mortar fire.</p>
            <p>Security checkpoints at al-Arish airport, near the border with
Israel and the Gaza Strip, and a police station in Rafah were
targeted, officials said.</p>
            <p>Sinai has seen a series of militant attacks on security
installations and oil pipelines over the past two years, and it is
unclear whether the latest attacks are linked to the political
upheaval.</p>
