            <p class="introduction">Work has begun on a
memorial in Germany for the 300,000 people murdered by the Nazis
for having mental and physical disabilities or chronic
illnesses.</p>
            <p>A 30m (100ft) long glass wall is being built in the centre of
Berlin, near the former site of the Nazi-era office that organised
the "euthanasia" programme.</p>
            <p>In 1939, Adolf Hitler told officials that people "considered
incurable" should be "granted a mercy killing".</p>
            <p>The programme ended officially in 1941, but continued covertly
until 1945.</p>
            <p>At first, personnel killed people by starvation and lethal
injection. They later used gas chambers at killing centres in
Germany and Austria.</p>
            <p>The programme, also known as Action T4, is considered a
precursor to the Holocaust, during which millions of Jews were
killed.</p>
            <p>On Monday, Germany's State Minister for Culture, Bernd Neumann,
said educating people about the Nazis' crimes and honouring their
victims remained an obligation for the country.</p>
            <p>In recent years, memorials have been constructed in Berlin for
Jewish, Roma (Gypsy) and homosexual victims of the Nazis.</p>
