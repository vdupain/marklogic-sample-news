            <p class="introduction">At least 14 people
have been killed in a series of attacks across Iraq.</p>
            <p>Seven people died when a bomb exploded on a busy street in
Nahrawan, a south-eastern suburb of the capital, Baghdad. The
bodies of three builders were also found in the nearby area of
Zafaraniya.</p>
            <p>Later, two car bomb blasts killed four people in the northern
city of Mosul.</p>
            <p>The deaths bring to 123 the number of people killed since Monday
in a wave of bombings and attacks across Iraq, amid an upsurge in
sectarian violence.</p>
            <p>No groups have said they were behind the recent violence, but
much of it has occurred in predominantly Shia Muslim areas.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday, at least six car bombs exploded in markets and
commercial areas of the capital. In total, at least 49 people were
killed nationwide.</p>
            <p>The UN has said that more than 2,500 people were killed in
April, May and June, which is believed to be more than twice the
death toll from violence in the first three months of the year.</p>
            <p>A Kurdish MP said the situation was unlikely to improve because
it would soon by the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when militants
have stepped up their attacks in recent years.</p>
            <p>"Nothing will change," Hassan Jihad, who sits on parliament's
security and defence committee, told the AFP news agency.</p>
            <p>"This month will not be better because the security forces will
carry out the same routine," he warned, adding that militants would
"continue to show that they are everywhere, that they can reach any
place".</p>
            <p>The upsurge in sectarian violence was sparked by an army raid on
a Sunni anti-government protest camp near the northern town of
Hawija in April that left 50 people dead.</p>
            <p>The protesters were calling for the resignation of Shia Prime
Minister Nouri Maliki and denouncing the authorities for allegedly
targeting the Sunni community.</p>
            <p>Although the violence is less deadly than that seen during the
heights of the insurgency in 2006 and 2007, it is the most
widespread since the US military withdrawal in 2011.</p>
