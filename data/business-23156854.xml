may escalate into a bigger crisis</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The price of US
light crude oil hit a 14-month high on Wednesday to over $100 a
barrel on concerns over political turmoil in Egypt.</p>
            <p>The benchmark US crude rose $1.64 to $101.2 a barrel, its
highest since May 2012, while Brent crude rose 1.76% to $105.76 a
barrel.</p>
            <p>As well Middle East worries, rising US demand for oil also
boosted prices.</p>
            <p>The US Energy Department said that weekly US crude supplies fell
by 10.3 million barrels.</p>
            <p>That was the biggest fall in 13 years and was more than three
times the drop that had been expected.</p>
            <p>It was partly due to a temporary reduction in supplies from
Canada as well as increased demand from a refinery in Indiana that
had just restarted work.</p>
            <p>Traders also worried that the volatile political situation in
Egypt could interrupt oil flows through the Suez Canal and the
wider Middle East, which account for around 25% of the world's oil
output.</p>
            <p>The Egyptian president, Mohammed Morsi, is facing protests from
millions of protesters, and the Egyptian military is threatening to
disband parliament and put in place a new leadership.</p>
            <p>The Suez Canal sees just over 2% of world oil needs pass through
it daily.</p>
            <p>The Suez Canal Authority, which operates the waterway, said it
"has all the authorities needed for running the Canal without being
limited by the laws and the systems of the [Egyptian]
government".</p>
            <p>The rises came despite economic signals from China earlier on
Wednesday which suggested construction activity in the country was
slowing down - the latest sign of weakening growth - and weakening
growth in demand for raw materials - from the country.</p>
