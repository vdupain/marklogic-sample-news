               <span style="width:304px;">Prof Pendry said it was "a great honour" to receive
the Isaac Newton Medal</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The physicist who
proposed the idea of an "invisibility cloak" has received the
Newton Medal, the highest honour of the UK's Institute of Physics
(IoP).</p>
            <p>Imperial College London's Prof Sir John Pendry was cited "for
his seminal contributions to surface science, disordered systems
and photonics".</p>
            <p>But his work on cloaking and "metamaterials" is arguably his
most famous and potentially transformative.</p>
            <p>IoP president Peter Knight called the award "our most important
medal".</p>
            <p>The institute announced <a href="http://www.iop.org/about/awards/page_60410.html">a raft of other
awards and honorary fellowships</a> on Monday.</p>
            <p>Prof Pendry first gained notoriety outside the field of physics
when he <a href="/1/hi/sci/tech/5016068.stm"
               title="Plan for cloaking device unveiled">published an idea for an
"invisibility cloak"</a> in 2006.</p>
            <p>The concept made use of metamaterials - whose properties are not
defined by their chemical makeup but rather by their structure on
the tiniest scales - to guide light around an object, rendering it
in effect invisible.</p>
            <p>"The whole set of ideas was inspired by something very practical
- it came about because I was consulting for the Marconi company on
some very mundane material they used to absorb radar, which worked
very well but they didn't know how it worked," Prof Pendry told BBC
News.</p>
            <p>"Coming to understand that and to explain that led me to a whole
new area of research."</p>
            <p>Since then, the field has burgeoned, and the ideas laid out in
that first paper have spread to many more applications, ranging
from acoustic cloaking to cloaking buildings from earthquakes.</p>
            <p>However, suggestions in the intervening years of an imminent
invisibility cloak popularised by the Harry Potter franchise
<a href="/news/science-environment-19661503"
               title="Where's my cloak of invisibility?">may have been
misguided</a>.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Simple ideas have flourished as a whole new field of
research looks to capitalise on "invisibility"</span>
            </div>
            <p>"I think it illustrates yet again the unpredictability of
research," Prof Pendry said of the proliferation of work on the
topic.</p>
            <p>"When you have an original idea, if it's a really good one, you
don't know where it's going, because it's bigger than you are.</p>
            <p>"I had no idea when I started with a few simple notions that it
would actually go so far."</p>
            <p>Prof Sir Peter Knight, president of the IoP, said he was
"delighted" that the award had gone to Prof Pendry.</p>
            <p>"The Newton Medal is really the most important we have at the
IoP, and it's to recognise real distinction in physics," he told
BBC News.</p>
            <p>"My personal view is that what John Pendry has done with his
work on metamaterials, on perfect lensing, on cloaking - that work
is the most exciting that I've seen in optics in a generation."</p>
            <p>But he added that the award was for a far broader body of work
in theoretical physics - from the theory of surfaces to how
electrons bounce off of messy, "disordered systems".</p>
            <p>"John is an incredibly brave character who usually has a decade
of activity and then moves on," Prof Knight said.</p>
            <p>"What he's done is taken a deep breath every decade and said,
'OK, done that, enjoyed that, where are the big issues somewhere
else that I can make a big impact on?'"</p>
            <p>The Newton medal and prize of Ã‚Â£1,000
will be presented at a ceremony in London on 15 November.</p>
