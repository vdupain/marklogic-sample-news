            <p class="introduction">Authorities in Peru
say an ancient pyramid at the oldest archaeological site near the
capital, Lima, has been destroyed.</p>
            <p>They are pressing criminal charges against two real-estate
companies blamed for tearing down the structure, which was 6m
(20-ft) high.</p>
            <p>An archaeologist said those responsible had committed
"irreparable damage".</p>
            <p>The building was one of 12 pyramids found at the El Paraiso
complex and is thought to be at least 4,000 years old.</p>
            <p>The site, which dates back to the Late Preceramic (3500-1800 BC)
period, is situated several kilometres north of Lima.</p>
            <p>According to Peru's tourism ministry, it
was a religious and administrative centre long before the
pre-Columbian Inca civilisation.</p>
            <p>Rafael Varon, deputy minister of cultural patrimony, said the
destruction had taken place over the weekend. He said company
workers using heavy machinery had attempted to destroy three
further pyramids, but had been stopped by onlookers.</p>
            <p>Mr Varon said criminal complaints had been lodged against two
companies.</p>
            <p>Marco Guilen, director of an excavation project at El Paraiso,
told Associated Press news agency the people who tore down the
pyramid "have committed irreparable damage to a page of Peruvian
history".</p>
            <p>"We are not going to be able to know in what ways it was
constructed, what materials were used in it and how the society in
that part of the pyramid behaved."</p>
