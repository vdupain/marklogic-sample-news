               <span style="width:624px;">The IMF wants to raise public understanding of
economic problems facing governments around the world</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The International
Monetary Fund (IMF) is set to join an online university network and
will run finance courses which will be available free to students
around the world.</p>
            <p>This first step into the world of higher education will include
the topical subject of debt.</p>
            <p>The global organisation, responsible for promoting financial
stability, is going to deliver courses in partnership with the edX
online university platform, set up by Harvard and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p>The IMF will run two courses in financial policy, aimed
initially at government officials, with plans to make this open to
the public next year.</p>
            <p>These online university projects, so-called MOOCs (massive open
online courses), can attract hundreds of thousands of students for
individual courses.</p>
            <p>So why does the IMF think it should be teaching the world about
finance?</p>
            <p>Sharmini Coorey, director of the IMF's Institute for Capacity
Development, says the financial crisis has awakened interest in how
public finances are run.</p>
            <p>How are people meant to understand the big picture behind
problems such as unemployment?</p>
            <div class="caption body-width">

               <span style="width:464px;">Big screen in the IMF lobby: What does the public
believe about the downturn?</span>
            </div>
            <p>"When the public can understand the questions, then the level of
debate can increase. Informed debate can only be helpful," she
says.</p>
            <p>The IMF already runs training programmes for staff such as
central bankers and finance ministry officials, and Ms Coorey says
that the online university is a way of making this information
accessible to anyone with an internet connection.</p>
            <p>These are going to be uncompromising in their content - "based
on the latest collective wisdom on macro-economics" - but are
designed to give the public an insight into the issues facing their
governments' finance ministers.</p>
            <p>Following the semi-automated format of such courses, there will
be online questions accompanied by discussion forums where students
can share problems and get advice. Students will get a certificate
rather than a degree.</p>
            <p>The economic downturn has seen a deepening distrust between the
public and the financial sector. The skyscraper graphics and
trillion dollar budget conversations are a long way from
translating into everyday financial dilemmas such as trying to
afford to replace the car or organise a family holiday.</p>
            <p>And the course has the underlying aim of improving public
education on finances, taking the debate beyond the marble
corridors of central banks.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Improving understanding of finance could
help to tackle public distrust of the financial sector</span>
            </div>
            <p>The IMF's deputy managing director, Nemat Shafik, last week
highlighted how education and training needed to be much more
effectively harnessed in the pursuit of economic growth.</p>
            <p>She has welcomed how the partnership with edX will extend the
reach of the IMF's educational role. These online courses will
reach many more government staff, she says.</p>
            <p>But making these courses public will also "empower citizens
everywhere to understand the financial policy issues facing their
own countries".</p>
            <p>The edX online platform carrying the IMF courses is one of the
flagships of the new wave of digital universities.</p>
            <p>This not-for-profit partnership is already offering courses from
more than 20 leading universities, but the IMF course is the first
time that it will have been used to provide courses from an
international governmental institution.</p>
            <p>Anant Agarwal, president of edX and previously a MIT professor
of artificial intelligence, says the partnership with the IMF is
another example of how online learning is breaking down barriers in
learning, bringing in new types of organisation.</p>
            <p>He expects other institutions, corporations or NGOs to move into
this educational sphere.</p>
            <p>After only one year, the edX platform has
gained more than a million students in 192 countries. These range
from ambitious but isolated students in Africa through to people
already at university in the developed world.</p>
            <p>Students in India and China have been helped to get places in
MIT by their high achievement in edX online courses.</p>
            <p>Much of the original attention surrounding MOOCs revolved around
the involvement of some of the world's elite university brands.</p>
            <p>This raised questions about whether the traditional degree
course would be rendered over-priced and obsolete.</p>
            <p>But the impact of online learning has been much less
predictable.</p>
            <p>It seems as likely to change conventional campus-based courses
as much as opening up universities to remote learners.</p>
            <p>Prof Agarwal says the idea of mixing online learning with
conventional courses will become standard practice.</p>
            <p>"This will incorporate the best of online learning with the best
of learning in person," he predicts.</p>
            <p>Coursera, launched last year by academics at Stanford, recently
announced a huge expansion in a deal with 10 US state university
systems, with 1.25 million students between them.</p>
            <p>This will include universities producing online material for
students on their own courses. Students now expect to use the
internet to find information and they expect to have materials
accessible whenever they want to use them.</p>

               <span style="width:624px;">The IMF is going to offer two courses, using the
expertise of the training it already offers central
bankers</span>
            </div>
            <p>If they attend a lecture they might want to be able to play it
back on their laptop.</p>
            <p>Another factor created by this type of online accessibility is
the permeability of information.</p>
            <p>Coursera has almost 3.9 million students following university
courses and each and every one of them can peer over the fence to
see how courses are taught in other institutions.</p>
            <p>Sceptics point to the high dropout rates and the problems with
accrediting such online courses, but it creates a level of
accessibility that would have been impossible only a few years
ago.</p>
            <p>The introduction of courses from the IMF shows the unexpected
blurring of boundaries around formal education. Who should be able
to teach? Where should people go to learn, a library or a search on
YouTube?</p>
            <p>The sheer scale of the online sharing of knowledge has also been
unprecedented. The free academic version of Apple's iTunes - iTunes
U - has now had one billion downloads of lectures and course
materials, drawing on a catalogue of 600,000 online academic
resources.</p>
            <p>This isn't just a parade of over-sized numbers, there are
unexpected involvements at a grassroots level. A few weeks ago the
Texas Association of School Administrators announced that it was
going to use material from iTunes U for high school courses across
14 school districts.</p>
            <p>If iTunes was first seen as the beginning of the end for CDs and
record shops, it would have been harder to predict that it would
also be the beginning for a new type of school curriculum.</p>
            <p>It's going to mean some different kinds of questions for
employers. Where did you get your qualifications? MIT, the IMF or
the Apple Store?</p>

                  <p>This is a great use of the internet. It will enable anyone
anywhere to access higher education of an international standard.
Organisations such as the IMF, WB, OECD and the UN are all funded
by tax payer funds of their own countries and making the
accumulated knowledge of these organisations available in a formal
learning program free of charge is one way to bridge the knowledge
divide</p>

               <blockquote>
                  <p>I have completed three MOOCs. The quality of material is
astoundingly good. The major flaws all surround the mundane,
practical matter of time zones, American Grammar and cultural
presumptions rather than quality of content. The marking machine
approach is harsh and unforgiving and time bound. It is entirely
possible to fail a course for late submission and much more likely.
Which has led me to regard the value of the courses being outside
of the certification. Excellent for obtaining the skills or body of
knowledge but useless for the certification obsessed world of
employers - who want over-certified, free labour. While, on paper,
that minimises risk it also has a the effect of excluding marginal
or low interest courses. MOOCs can (and, in some cases are)
bringing back some subjects that were only available to an elite.
Which, for me, is making my business more useful. But for the
average Supermarket or Retailer will just give them another stick
to beat down their costs by insisting on a quite difficult way of
learning. Which is sadly leading to MOOCs attempting to be "more
relevant to business" instead of being a means to making learning
accessible. In comparison to the Open University, the MOOCs are
primitive and sometimes counterproductive. They, very much, lack
the kind of real world community that has made the OU powerful and
worthwhile. But it really is early days. The OU has a lot more
experience at distance learning and that shows in the quality of
learning. Given the extortionate levels of fees being set by
Government the potential for MOOCs is enormous.</p>

               <blockquote>
                  <p>MOOCs are a valuable addition to university education, they do
not replace it. The whole problem of assessment, or testing is at
issue here. Normally, economic understanding (or any abstract,
analytical subject) can only be tested through long answer
questions, papers, and other time intensive assessment strategies.
Multiple choice questions cannot test high level understanding.
There are proponents who say that a properly worded multiple choice
exam, with distractors (wrong answers) aimed at making the student
select the "best" answer do assess higher level knowledge. As a
college instructor, I completely disagree with this. There is
always more than one correct way to approach an issue involving
analysis and abstract thought. A proper decision is made only after
analysis of all solutions, and analysis of the current situation.
Selecting the "best" answer means that the tester has narrowed down
the situation to one, and assumes that there is only one way to do
something. A multiple choice exam cannot see the critical thought
processes. Multiple choice exams have their place, for assessing
knowledge, but not for assessing the application of, or synthesis
of that knowledge. That is what we want people to be able to do, to
use their knowledge. So, with MOOCs proper marking is impossible.
However, as a way to augment knowledge they are excellent. As
interest courses, they are fantastic. But they do not replace
classroom education. Many administrators, would love to see that
happen. Talk about financial saving for the school.</p>

               <blockquote>
                  <p>For Africa clearly MOOCs represent an alternative route to
quality education that is responsive to the needs of the 21st
Century Economy. Truth is much of the curriculum in higher
education across the continent lags behinds the developments over
the last two decades and indeed is not preparing our grads for the
future. With the MOOCs students enrolled in the local universities
and polytechnics get the chance to consolidate on what they learn
through taking courses from highly qualified professors in renowned
universities and getting skilled for the world of world.
Organizations like the IMF entering the field can only make it
better. As a university teacher here in Ghana, I am excited about
the prospects of MOOCs extending their tentacles to the nook and
cranny of the world. These are exciting times to be a learner.</p>
