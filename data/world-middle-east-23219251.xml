before in the village of Sitra</span>

            <p class="introduction">Two attacks in
Shia-majority villages in the Gulf state of Bahrain have left one
police officer dead and at least three others injured, officials
say.</p>
            <p>A bomb exploded at the police station in Sitra, killing one
officer, while three police were injured in a petrol bomb attack in
Janabiya.</p>
            <p>More than 60 people have died since pro-democracy protests broke
out in the island kingdom in February 2011.</p>
            <p>Bahrain's ruling family is Sunni Muslim but most of the
population are Shia.</p>
            <p>Sitra, not far from the capital Manama, has been the scene of
previous clashes between police and anti-government protesters.</p>

            <p>A statement from the Bahrain News Agency, quoted by the AFP news
agency, said two police officers had also been injured there.</p>
            <p>In Janabiya, three police officers were hurt when their patrol
was attacked with petrol bombs, the interior ministry said.</p>
            <p>Later, the Interior Ministry said three policemen were injured
when their patrol was hit by firebombs in another area of the
strategic kingdom, which is home to the US Navy's 5th Fleet.</p>
            <p>Youths armed with petrol bombs attack police on an almost
nightly basis in villages and towns around the capital.</p>
            <p>The police respond with teargas, stun grenades and birdshot but
are frequently accused by the opposition of using excessive force
against protesters.</p>
            <p>The opposition says that helps fuel an ongoing cycle of
violence.</p>
