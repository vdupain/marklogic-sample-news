            <p class="introduction">Tens of thousands of
workers across Brazil joined a day of strikes called by trade
unions that ended in clashes between police and protesters.</p>
            <p>Ports and motorways were blocked, banks and schools stayed
closed, and crowds marched through Rio de Janeiro, where riot
police deployed tear gas.</p>
            <p>The unions want improved working conditions and better public
services.</p>
            <p>The crowds were smaller than in last month's protests, which
brought more than a million people onto the streets.</p>
            <p>The June demonstrations were sparked by transport fare rises,
but quickly encompassed other issues including the cost of staging
the World Cup and corruption.</p>
            <p>Those demonstrations often ended in fighting between police and
protesters.</p>
            <p>Thursday's so-called "National Day of Struggles" was largely
peaceful.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Riot police moved in to quell the
protests in Rio</span>
            </div>
            <p>However, several thousand protesters clashed with police in Rio
and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Julia Carneiro in Rio says Thursday's day of action
was much more traditional than the earlier demonstrations, with
trade unions and political banners prominent in the crowds.</p>
            <p>The protesters' demands included the reduction of working hours,
more investment in health and education, and free public
transport.</p>
            <p>History teacher Fernando da Costa Vieira said the event had a
clearer agenda than June's protests and put the unions back at the
centre of the debate.</p>
            <p>"Here you have representatives of professors, doctors,
transportation workers. These sectors had been fractured, they had
forgotten their role as the vanguard of the working class," he told
the BBC.</p>
            <p>The action hit at least 10 states, bringing to a halt activities
at Brazil's busiest port, Santos, and in Itaguai, in the south, and
Suape, in the north-east.</p>
            <p>In many cities, public transport was brought to a near
standstill, among them Porto Alegre, Salvador and Belo
Horizonte.</p>
            <p>In Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo, an estimated 4,000-strong
crowd again blocked the renowned Avenida Paulista.</p>
            <p>The nationwide demonstrations in June for better education,
healthcare and transport prompted President Dilma Rousseff to
present a package of investment and reforms in public services.</p>
            <p>Ms Rousseff also proposed a national plebiscite on political
reform, but members of the Congress recently said it would be
practically impossible to organise a public consultation on the
issue before next year's elections.</p>
