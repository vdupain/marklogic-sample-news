order to evacuate"</p>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The evacuation of
Asiana flight 214, which crash landed on Saturday in San Francisco,
was delayed because the pilots initially said passengers should
stay put, a safety official has said.</p>
            <p>The evacuation began 90 seconds after the Boeing 777 skidded to
a stop - and only after a flight attendant spotted fire outside,
the official said.</p>
            <p>She called the failure to order the evacuation immediately
"unusual".</p>
            <p>The crash killed two passengers and injured about 180.</p>
            <p>At a press conference on Wednesday, National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Deborah Hersman said the pilots were
in contact with air traffic controllers in the seconds after the
plane crashed, and told flight attendants not to order passengers
to evacuate.</p>
            <p>"It seems a little unusual that the crew would not announce an
order to evacuate after a plane crash," Ms Hersman said.</p>
            <p>"We don't know what the pilots were thinking."</p>
            <p>Ms Hersman also confirmed some of the evacuation slides had
inflated inside the aircraft as it bounced along the ground,
injuring a flight attendant and possibly hindering passengers'
escape.</p>
            <p>It has been revealed that the pilot at the controls when the
plane crashed was landing a Boeing 777 at San Francisco's airport
for the first time, while the instructor pilot beside him was in
that role also for the first time.</p>
            <p>Ms Hersman said the pilot who landed the plane later told
investigators he was blinded by a light at about 500ft (150m) -
which would have been about 34 seconds before impact and the point
when the Boeing began to slow down.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">US investigators have interviewed the
pilots and half of the flight attendants on the crashed
plane</span>
            </div>
            <p>The possibility that the flash was caused by a laser was not
being ruled out, Ms Hersman added.</p>
            <p>Aside from the pilot's relative inexperience in a Boeing 777, it
has also emerged that the instructor pilot reported noticing
seconds before the crash that the auto-throttle was not maintaining
the correct airspeed.</p>
            <p>US investigators are continuing to review flight data and video
footage, and have interviewed all four pilots and half of the
flight attendants.</p>
            <p>The additional attendants remain in hospital, among them three
who were ejected from the rear of the aircraft when the tail ripped
off on impact.</p>
            <p>As Asiana 214, bound from Incheon in South Korea, approached San
Francisco after its 11-hour journey across the Pacific Ocean, three
out of four pilots aboard were in the cockpit.</p>
            <p>The plane came in much too shallowly and under the airspeed
necessary to keep it aloft. The main landing gear struck a seawall
well short of the end of the runway, and the aircraft's tail was
ripped off. It then went into a 360-degree spin before coming to
rest to the left of the runway.</p>
            <p>The first airport emergency crews arrived about 30 seconds after
the passengers began evacuating.</p>
            <p>At least 30 surviving passengers remain in San Francisco
hospitals, many with serious spinal injuries.</p>
            <p>The two passengers killed were Chinese teenagers Ye Mengyuan and
Wang Linjia. They had been sitting in the rear of the plane, where
many of the most seriously injured passengers were seated, but
their bodies were found on the tarmac.</p>
            <p>Police are investigating whether one of them survived the crash
only to be run over by an emergency vehicle.</p>
