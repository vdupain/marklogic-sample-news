            <p class="introduction">The court set up to
make sure the worst Balkans war criminals faced justice is under
unprecedented scrutiny.</p>
            <p>Critics say recent changes at the court in The Hague - perhaps
made under political pressure - have allowed several top suspects
to walk free.</p>
            <p>Last week an email reportedly written by a Danish judge emerged
that claimed external forces were manipulating the court - the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) -
to protect themselves from future investigations.</p>
            <p>One of the recent cases causing concern is that of Franko
Simatovic and Jovica Stanisic - two of the highest-ranking Serbian
state officials to appear before the tribunal accused of war
crimes.</p>
            <p>They established and trained the feared
Serb paramilitary squads that terrorised non-Serbs in Bosnia and
Croatia, and provided the weapons that were used to unlawfully kill
them.</p>
            <p>But, last month, they were found not guilty and acquitted on all
counts.</p>
            <p>The majority of judges decided that there was insufficient
evidence to be sure they acted with criminal intentions.</p>
            <p>Some lawyers with experience at the ICTY say this is an example
of a case in which the evidence would formerly have been sufficient
to reach a conviction - and that there has been a fundamental
change of the court's interpretation.</p>
            <p>Lawyer Karijn van der Voort, who worked on the Simatovic case,
explains: "There has been a shift in the burden of proof required,
especially relating to aiding and abetting."</p>
            <p>She says the change was first apparent in the case of Momcilo
Perisic, the Yugoslav army commander acquitted on appeal in
February this year after initially being sentenced to 27 years in
prison.</p>
            <p>"The Perisic appeals
chamberÃ¢Â€Â¦ stated that if an
organisation committed lawful and unlawful acts, if someone
assisted that organisation in any way, you had to prove that the
actions of the accused were specifically directed towards the
criminal acts of the organisation," says Ms van der Voort.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Critics also point to the overturned conviction, in November
2012, of Croatian generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac, who led
an operation against Serbs in Croatia's Krajina region.</p>
            <p>In earlier cases generals and politicians were convicted on the
principle that they were part of a "joint criminal enterprise" with
the thugs carrying out massacres on the ground.</p>
            <p>Nenad Golcevski, from the Humanitarian Law Center, says recent
rulings have undermined the court, which many in the region hoped
would be an instrument for recognition and reconciliation.</p>
            <p>"It has lost respect, it has lost credibility, in the region and
internationally. We feel as though the rug has been pulled from
beneath us."</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Under the old rules, Richard Holbrooke
and Bill Clinton "could have been convicted"</span>
            </div>
            <p>The implications of these verdicts may go beyond the borders of
the Balkans.</p>
            <p>As US President Barack Obama considers whether to arm the Syrian
rebels, lawyers say the legal basis for holding anyone to account
for aiding and abetting those responsible for committing atrocities
may have been defined just in time.</p>
            <p>They say it will ensure the US or any other states that wish to
intervene cannot be held responsible for any acts that violate
international law if they did not "specifically direct" that the
weapons should be used to commit the crimes.</p>
            <p>Peter Robinson, the Californian lawyer currently representing
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at the ICTY, says: "It allows
the US and UK and other people who want to intervene on the side of
the rebels not to fear that they would be prosecuted if the rebels
go ahead and commit crimes with some of the arms or funds that are
provided for them."</p>
            <p>"Under aiding and abetting the way it was, they could have
convicted [former US President] Bill Clinton, [US diplomat] Richard
Holbrooke. They all authorised weapons to go to the Bosnian Muslims
at a time when they knew they were committing crimes - so it needed
to be reined in a little bit."</p>
            <p>For some, the credibility of the court has been further called
into question by an email reportedly written by an ICTY judge,
Frederik Harhoff of Denmark, in which he said fellow judges were
apparently coming under pressure to reach an acquittal.</p>
            <p>The British barrister Geoffrey Nice, who was prosecutor in the
case against former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, is
leading calls for an investigation.</p>
            <p>"It is at least possible that the US and
or countries like the UK were frightened of the consequences for
their countries (although there has never been any suggestion of
improper pressure by the UK government that I have heard of)."</p>
            <p>He says there are concerns that the recent judgements may now
provide grounds for appeal against earlier convictions.</p>
            <p>The BBC asked for either the ICTY president, prosecutor or press
office to respond to the allegations against the court. All
requests have been rejected.</p>
            <p>But Luka Misetic, who defended Croatian General Ante Gotovina,
has little time for what he calls "conspiracy theories".</p>
            <p>"When people don't get the judgements they want, they say the
only reason it can be is politics," he says. "The judgements aren't
consistent to support this, I see little evidence to support
them."</p>

found not responsible for their actions</span>
            </div>
            <p>And a professor of law at Leiden University, Dov Jacobs,
agrees.</p>
            <p>"Those trials were, for many people, always meant to just
confirm guilt.... Now there are acquittals in the recent cases," he
says.</p>
            <p>"They think the moral agenda, the moral aim of finding guilt, is
not being achieved."</p>
            <p>But legal experts say changes in how the law is being
interpreted will effectively allow those at the top to avoid
liability.</p>
            <p>Lawyer Karijn van der Voort says: "By raising the bar so high,
it is making the top people almost impossible to convict."</p>
            <p>And Satko Mujagic, who was imprisoned at Omarska, one of the
most notorious Serb detention centres, calls it "a slap in the face
for the victims".</p>
            <p>"You cannot admit that these people founded the forces that
committed the mass war crimes over a period of four years and then
conclude it is not their fault," he says.</p>
            <p>"What does that tell Serbs now? That they did nothing
wrong."</p>
