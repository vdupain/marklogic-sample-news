track for two decades</span>

            <p class="introduction">Ethiopian athletics
star Haile Gebrselassie says he is entering politics with the aim
of winning a parliamentary seat in the 2015 election.</p>
            <p>The 40-year-old's announcement follows long-standing rumours
that his athletics career is drawing to a close.</p>
            <p>Mr Haile, a two-time Olympic 10,000m champion, is regarded as a
national icon by most Ethiopians.</p>
            <p>He has not said under which party's banner he will contest the
election.</p>
            <p>Ethiopia's parliament is dominated by the ruling Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). It has only one
opposition MP.</p>
            <p>"A lot of messages in the news about me going into politics,"
<a href="https://twitter.com/HaileGebr"
               title="Link to Haile Gebreselassie's Twitter account">Mr Haile said on
Twitter</a>.</p>
            <p>"Yes, I want to be in the parliament in 2015 to help my country
to move forward."</p>
            <p>Mr Haile is a four-time world 10,000m champion and won gold at
the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games.</p>
            <p>He officially announced his retirement in 2010 but then went on
to compete in races after recovering from a knee injury.</p>
            <p>In April, he won his third consecutive Vienna half marathon and
also took part in the Boston marathon, which was hit by a double
bomb attack that killed three people.</p>
            <p>The EPRDF is accused by rights groups of leading a highly
repressive regime, using anti-terrorism law as a pretext to
imprison opposition activists and journalists.</p>
