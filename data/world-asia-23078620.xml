               <span style="width:304px;">The Burmese government is eager to use telecoms
technology to spur economic development</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Burma has awarded
lucrative mobile telecom licences to Norway's Telenor and the
Qatari firm Ooredoo, a government committee in charge of bids has
said.</p>
            <p>The move opens up one of the world's last untapped mobile phone
markets.</p>
            <p>It is estimated that just 9% of Burma's 60 million people have
mobile phones.</p>
            <p>Eleven foreign companies were short-listed in their bid to
supply telecommunications infrastructure in the country.</p>
            <p>The winners overcame fierce competition from the likes of
Singtel and Bharti Airtel, as well as a bid by the Digicel group
involving one of Burma's richest men, Serge Pun, and the
billionaire financier George Soros.</p>
            <p>The successful firms will have to provide voice services across
75% of the country within five years and data services across half
of it.</p>
            <p>At the moment, few people in Burma, also known as Myanmar, can
afford mobile phone handsets and call charges.</p>
            <p>"We are looking forward to working with the government and
people of Myanmar in developing the country's telecommunication
industry, a sector that will play a key role in Myanmar's
socioeconomic development," said Sigve Brekke, head of Telenor
Asia.</p>
            <p>Neither Telenor nor Ooredoo released figures on the value of
their bids or how much money they will plough into establishing a
mobile network across the country.</p>
            <p>However, one bidder said it would cost more than
Ã‚Â£2bn to build an extensive mobile network
in Burma, while Digicel said it was prepared to invest
Ã‚Â£6bn if it won.</p>
            <p>The government said it would finalise the 15-year licences by
September and operators would need to launch services within nine
months.</p>
            <p>The process of opening up the mobile telecom sector is
conditional on a telecommunications law that has yet to pass
through Burma's parliament.</p>
            <p>France's Telecom-Orange and Marubeni Corporation of Japan will
be back-up options if either of the two successful firms fail to
meet the selection criteria, the selection committee said.</p>
            <p>Analysts said the licence-granting process was an indication of
the progress of Burma's economic reform programme.</p>
            <p>The country lags behind its neighbours in mobile coverage and
wants to provide affordable services to help spur economic
development.</p>
