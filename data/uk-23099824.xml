            <p class="introduction">The Old Bailey trial
of two men accused of murdering soldier Lee Rigby has been set for
18 November.</p>
            <p>Michael Adebolajo, 28, from Romford, east London, and Michael
Adebowale, 22, from Greenwich, south-east London, appeared at the
court via video link from separate rooms at Belmarsh prison.</p>
            <p>They are accused of murdering Drummer Rigby outside Woolwich
barracks on 22 May.</p>
            <p>Members of the soldier's family were in court to see the
proceedings.</p>
            <p>Mr Adebolajo, whose left arm appeared to be in a cast, is also
accused of the attempted murder of two police officers and
possession of a firearm with intent to cause others to believe that
violence would be used.</p>
            <p>The suspects spoke only to confirm their names during the
20-minute hearing.</p>
            <p>Both were flanked by two prison officers.</p>
            <p>They were remanded in custody to appear for another preliminary
hearing at the Old Bailey on 27 September.</p>
