on atoms to measure time</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Scientists say they
have found a more accurate way to measure time.</p>
            <p>We currently use atomic clocks to count the seconds, but tests
on an alternative atomic timekeeper have revealed that it is more
precise.</p>
            <p>The French researchers said the clocks, which are called optical
lattice clocks, lost just one second every 300 million years.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms3109">Writing in Nature
Communications</a>, the team said they offered a better system for
defining the second.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>Laser show</strong>
            </p>
            <p>We once used the Earth's rotation to measure time, where one
spin equates to a day.</p>
            <p>But because our planet wobbles on its axis as it rotates, some
days can be shorter or longer than others.</p>
            <p>The atomic clock has proved to be a far more accurate method of
keeping the world on time and since the 1960s has been used to
define a second in the International System of Units (SI
units).</p>
            <p>But now scientists say the optical lattice clock could improve
the precision.</p>
            <p>Just as a grandfather clock uses the swing of a pendulum to
measure intervals of time, an atomic clock uses the very regular
"vibrations" of atoms.</p>
            <p>Our current systems, called caesium fountains, expose clouds of
caesium atoms to microwaves to get them to oscillate. But the the
new ones use light to excite strontium atoms.</p>
            <p>Dr Jerome Lodewyck, from the Paris Observatory, said: "In our
clocks we use laser beams. Laser beams oscillate much faster than
microwave radiation, and in a sense we divide time in much shorter
intervals so we can measure time more precisely."</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">The researchers believe the new clock could be used
as a standard for the world's time</span>
            </div>
            <p>The optical clocks are three times as accurate as caesium
fountains, which are accurate to one second every 100 million
years.</p>
            <p>As well as comparing the optical lattice clocks with our current
atomic timekeepers, the researchers compared two optical clocks
with each other. They found that they kept time in agreement, and
were also very stable.</p>
            <p>"For instance, if you have your wristwatch, and one day you are
one second late, and one day one second early, then your clock is
not stable. But it could still have good accuracy if over a million
days the time is correct ," Dr Lodewyck explained.</p>
            <p>It is important to measure both accuracy and stability, he
added.</p>
            <p>Many technologies such as telecommunications, satellite
navigation and the stock markets rely on ever-better time
measurements. The researchers said the new clocks could one day
help to redefine the second.</p>
            <p>Another clock is also undergoing development - an ion clock.
This clock loses just one second every few billion years, but
because it relies on a single ion, it is not yet deemed to be
stable enough for widespread use.</p>
