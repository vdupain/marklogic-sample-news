            <p>
               <strong>Dr Kermit Gosnell began as a
pillar of his community. Now, he's a national disgrace. For years,
officials knew of problems at his clinic but did nothing about
them. Some say a new law passed in response to the scandal is
putting patients at further risk.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Dr Kermit Gosnell is no longer a danger to others. He spends his
days writing poetry, learning Spanish and jogging on the spot. At
72, he keeps active. But he's disappointed. He really thought he
could beat the murder charges.</p>
            <p>"He still believes, despite what the jury found, that he never
killed a live baby," says his lawyer, Jack McMahon.</p>
            <p>Gosnell performed some 16,000 abortions over 31 years at his
clinic in west Philadelphia - a poor neighbourhood in one of the
poorest big cities in the United States.</p>
            <p>According to those responsible for regulating abortion clinics,
his practice was fine. But they hadn't checked. Or listened to
complaints from doctors and other professionals. Or done anything
after two women died from treatment there.</p>
            <p>Gosnell was only stopped in 2010, when
police executing a drug warrant entered the clinic and found feet
in jars, bones in drains and foetuses stored in freezers above
refrigerators that held workers' lunches.</p>
            <p>The gruesome details - including the dangerous, even lethal
practice of using untrained staff to sedate women - are catalogued
in the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/districtattorney/pdfs/grandjurywomensmedical.pdf">
grand jury report</a>. Last month a judge sentenced Gosnell to
three consecutive life sentences for killing three newborns by
snipping their spinal cords at the neck.</p>
            <p>Jack McMahon says in 35 years as an attorney, he's never seen
such a backlash against a client, who was widely termed a
"monster". His own cousin told him, "I love you, but I hope you
don't win," McMahon says.</p>
            <p>That strength of feeling is now driving the debate about
abortion in the United States.</p>
            <p>Kermit Gosnell is the son of a prominent African-American family
in west Philadelphia. He attended one of the city's top high
schools before going on to study medicine locally at Thomas
Jefferson University.</p>
            <p>"He was probably at that time the only African-American medical
student there," says Joe Slobodzian, who has covered Gosnell for
the Philadelphia Inquirer. "And from every indication, he
excelled."</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Several former clinic employees pleaded
guilty to murder</span>
            </div>
            <p>In 1979, Gosnell opened the Women's Medical Society in his old
neighbourhood, at 3801 Lancaster Avenue. Pete Wilson, a local
political activist with an office just up the road, says people
used to look up to him.</p>
            <p>"I guess he did the best he could for the community he lived in.
Initially, he thought he was helping people, 13, 14, 15-year-old
girls that had made mistakes, their parents bought them in."</p>
            <p>Wilson says the rooms inside were small and dimly lit. "It just
didn't seem like it was the kind of medical situation you would
want to be in - not unless you were desperate. Because the
abortions weren't expensive. He was cheap. So that brought people
who couldn't afford to go anywhere but to him."</p>
            <p>It's estimated Gosnell was making $1.8m
(Ã‚Â£1.1m) a year. He saved money by hiring
unqualified staff. One "anaesthetist" had never finished high
school.</p>
            <p>District attorney Seth Williams ties Gosnell's attitude to money
directly to the murders. In a legal abortion, the foetus is
injected with a lethal drug before the mother gives birth - but
Gosnell didn't do this.</p>
            <p>"That takes money and it was cheaper for him to just induce
labour and then murder the child," Williams says.</p>
            <p>Abortion has been legal in the United States since 1973. Each
state sets limits on when abortions can be done, up to a national
maximum of 24 weeks. The average pregnancy lasts 38 weeks. In
Pennsylvania, where Gosnell practiced, the limit is 24 weeks.</p>
            <p>"He was known in the community for doing abortions - didn't
matter what the gestation was," says Pennsylvania State
Representative Margo Davidson. Her cousin died following an
abortion at Gosnell's clinic in 2000. "You could get it done
quickly, you could get it done cheaply, without any questions
asked."</p>
            <p>Joe Slobodzian says Gosnell had gained a reputation as "the
abortion doctor of last resort" across the east coast of the United
States.</p>
            <p>Now, his notoriety has spread nationwide. Pro-life
organisations, which see any abortion as the murder of a child,
have put great emphasis on the Gosnell case. One says it has
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/t91Pa3uZAHI">put abortion
itself on trial</a>.</p>
            <p>"There are a lot of people thinking very differently because of
this case than they ever thought before," says Dr Day Gardner,
president of the National Black Pro-Life Union.</p>
            <p>"There are many member of Congress who
are saying, 'We need to change the laws.'"</p>
            <p>Shortly after that interview, members of Congress proved her
right. They said "Gosnell" 63 times in a <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-06-18/pdf/CREC-2013-06-18.pdf">
60-minute debate last week</a>, which ended in a vote to approve a
Republican bill, H.R. 1797, that would ban abortions nationwide
after 20 weeks.</p>
            <p>Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn called it "an appropriate
response to Kermit Gosnell's house of horrors." Opponents noted
that murdering babies was already illegal - it's just that in
Gosnell's case, no one was enforcing the law.</p>
            <p>"It was a total failure of the governmental entities that have
oversight over these facilities," says District Attorney Seth
Williams. He found that Gosnell's clinic was last inspected in
1993.</p>
            <p>"There was more inspection and oversight over public pools than
over abortion clinics unfortunately in the commonwealth of
Pennsylvania."</p>
            <p>Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett has
said bureaucrats simply weren't doing their jobs, and some have
been fired. No-one from the health departments of the City of
Philadelphia and the State of Pennsylvania would agree to be
interviewed by the BBC. But a lawyer for the state Department of
Health, Kenneth Brody, is quoted in a grand jury report into
Gosnell, saying that a decision was taken to not regularly inspect
clinics.</p>
            <p>"There was a concern that if they did routine inspections, that
they might find a lot of these facilities didn't meet [the
standards]Ã¢Â€Â¦ and then there
would be less abortion facilities, less access to women having
abortion", he said.</p>
            <p>The political reaction in Pennsylvania was swift.</p>
            <p>A new law, Act 122, came into force last year and since then the
State Department of Health has spent "1,500 man hours" inspecting
abortion facilities, a spokeswoman told the BBC in an email.</p>
            <p>"Our dedication to tougher oversight and ensuring full
compliance with the law will continue far beyond Gosnell. We have a
responsibility to create safer environments for women and to hold
facilities accountable to higher standards and we will continue to
fulfil that responsibility."</p>
            <p>This debate about standards is happening in many states,
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23058736">most
notably in Texas</a> - where pro-Life campaigners have branded one
clinic providing abortions "another Gosnell".</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">State senator Wendy Davis spoke for 10 hours to
block a 20-week limit in Texas</span>
            </div>
            <p>But those who provide abortions say some of the higher standards
have nothing to do with Gosnell, or even making women safer.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Women's Center is the city's oldest abortion
provider, part of the National Abortion Federation, an industry
body which regularly inspects member clinics. (Gosnell's clinic, of
course, was not a member.) It's always been clean and airy, says
director Elizabeth Barnes, but recently installed a new heating and
cooling system to comply with Act 122.</p>
            <p>"We actually had to cut through the roof of our building,
through the business of the floor above us and hire a crane to
bring in the units which were brought in from the Midwest, because
there was nowhere local that even made them," Barnes says.</p>
            <p>Her overall bill for complying with Act 122 is almost $500,000
(Ã‚Â£326,000). Money wasted, she says, because
it doesn't make things safer "in any meaningful way".</p>
            <p>In fact, she says, by driving up the
cost, Act 122 is putting clinics out of business and making it
prohibitive for new ones to open.</p>
            <p>"Gosnell was able to stay open because there was a need and
no-one was filling it in his community," she says. "And what we
would hope for is that a good provider would rise in the place to
fill the need. But if there is no way to make a facility
financially viable, then facilities will not open."</p>
            <p>The result in that case, she says, will be "more Gosnells" -
more unsafe abortions.</p>
            <p>There were 24 abortion clinics in Pennsylvania before Act 122.
Today, there are 19. Demand for abortion, based on calls to
Philadelphia's sexual health hotline, Choice, has not changed.</p>
            <p>It's hard to say what that means. It could mean existing clinics
are picking up the slack. Women could be going to other states, or
underground. Or it could mean there will be fewer abortions.
Official figures for the number of abortions performed in 2012
won't be published for months.</p>
            <p>But State Representative Margo Davidson, who made an emotional
appeal for Act 122 during a debate in the State legislature,
telling the story of her 22-year-old cousin - who died "a gruelling
and painful death" after an abortion at Gosnell's clinic - says
it's crazy to think women today are less safe because of the new
law.</p>
            <p>"I was a poor black woman and I was a poor black girl, so if
there was a need for an abortion even in my circle of friends, we
came up with the money.</p>
            <p>"As long as there are clinics that are providing safe services,
poor women will find a way to terminate a pregnancy if they feel
that they desperately need to do so."</p>

            </div>
            <p>It's been three years since officers first raided Gosnell's
clinic. After his conviction in April, DA Seth Williams was given a
framed cartoon, which he keeps on his desk.</p>
            <p>"Why it's funny is that both political extremes will argue that
they were victorious with this conviction. I just try to continue
to tell people that our investigation and our prosecution had
nothing to do with the political or the moral decision of whether
or not abortions are correct.</p>
            <p>"Just that what he did was criminal. Children were being born
alive, that they breathed and moved, they cried, and he severed
their spinal cords and murdered them."</p>
