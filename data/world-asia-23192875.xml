            <p class="introduction">A judge in New
Zealand has ordered a coal mining company to pay compensation to
relatives of 29 men killed in a 2010 gas explosion.</p>
            <p>Pike River Coal was ordered to pay NZ$110,000 ($86,000,
Ã‚Â£57,000) to each victim's family and to two
men who survived the disaster at the South Island colliery,
totalling NZ$3.41m.</p>
            <p>But the firm is in receivership, so it is not clear this can be
paid in full.</p>
            <p>The mining disaster was New Zealand's worst in almost a
century.</p>
            <p>An official investigation last year found that the 19 November
blast at the mine, on the west coast of the South Island, was
caused by a methane gas explosion.</p>
            <p>It found that Pike River Coal failed to spot danger signs as it
tried to boost production at the colliery.</p>
            <p>In April the company was found guilty of multiple health and
safety violations.</p>
            <p>''There were many indicators that the mine was in a potential
explosive position but the warning signs were not noted or
heeded,'' Judge Jane Farish said at the sentencing hearing in
Greymouth on Friday.</p>
            <p>The company was also fined NZ$760,000. Its former chief
executive, Peter Whittall, faces a separate trial.</p>
            <p>The bodies of those who died remain inside the mine because
conditions are said to be too dangerous to recover them.</p>
