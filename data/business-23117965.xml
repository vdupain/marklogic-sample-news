aftermath of the nation's bailout</span>

            <p class="introduction">Cyprus's debt
ratings have been downgraded to "default" after it announced it
would delay paying back 1bn euros ($1.3bn;
Ã‚Â£860m) of bonds.</p>
            <p>Standard &amp; Poor's lowered the island's credit ratings to
"selective default" from CCC/C.</p>
            <p>Cyprus will swap government bonds maturing in 2013 through to
the first quarter of 2016 with new debt that matures at between
five and 10 years.</p>
            <p>The EU country has to do the bond swap to meet the terms of its
bailout.</p>
            <p>S&amp;P said on Friday that the "exchange materially changes the
terms of the affected debt and constitutes what we consider a
distressed exchange".</p>
            <p>"We view the extension of maturities without what we find to be
adequate offsetting compensation as the exchange of new debt on
less favourable terms to the existing debt."</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, Cyprus secured a loan package worth 10bn
euros from its EU partners and the International Monetary Fund.
This included a tax on large deposits and thorough banking reform,
which will raise 13bn euros.</p>
            <p>An early proposal to raise money through a levy on all Cypriot
bank deposits - including those below 100,000 euros - caused panic
in financial markets and was quickly withdrawn.</p>
            <p>Cyprus's rescue followed bailouts of Greece - twice - as well as
Ireland, Portugal and Spain's banks.</p>
            <p>After the bond swap, due on Monday, S&amp;P said its debt rating
was expected to rise back to CCC+. That still means the country's
debt is considered speculative and "currently vulnerable and
dependent on favourable business, financial and economic conditions
to meet financial commitments".</p>
            <p>But it added that the "government will still need to deal with"
with 950m euros worth of short-term debt that is due soon.</p>
            <p>That is the equivalent of 5% of the country's whole economy.</p>
