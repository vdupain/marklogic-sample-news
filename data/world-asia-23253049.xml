            <p class="introduction">Taiwan is braced for
the arrival of Typhoon Soulik, a tropical hurricane expected to
bring strong winds and torrential rain to the island.</p>
            <p>Schools and offices in northern cities are expected to close on
Friday afternoon as the storm nears.</p>
            <p>The typhoon was 450 km (280 miles) southeast of Yilan county on
Friday morning, Taiwan's weather bureau said.</p>
            <p>In 2009, Taiwan was hit by Typhoon Morakot, which left hundreds
dead in floods and mudslides.</p>

            <p>Typhoon Soulik, which was earlier classed as a "super typhoon",
weakened overnight and has been downgraded to a medium-force
typhoon.</p>
            <p>However, it still had wind speeds of around 173 km/hour (100
mph) on Friday morning.</p>
            <p>It is expected to hit north and northeast Taiwan on Friday,
before moving onto mainland China's eastern provinces on
Saturday.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of soldiers are on stand-by for emergency response
operations and 102 military camps have been prepared as emergency
shelters, the <a href="http://eoc.nfa.gov.tw/eoc/Uploads/2013/%E8%98%87%E5%8A%9B%E9%A2%B1%E9%A2%A8/%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E8%99%95%E7%BD%AE%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A/Typhoon%20Soulik%20Disaster%20Response%20Report%20-%201st.pdf">
Central Emergency Operations Center said</a>.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://eoc.nfa.gov.tw/eoc/List.aspx?ID=28&amp;MenuID=640&amp;ListID=1578">
In a statement</a>, the centre also warned that some areas of
Taiwan were prone to landslides.</p>
            <p>"The central region of Taiwan has experienced two earthquakes
with magnitude six or above on 27 March and 2 June, [and] loose
soil after seismic activities are potential disaster areas under
heavy rainfall," it said.</p>

harbour</span>
            </div>
            <p>It advised that fishing boats return to the shore before the
typhoon hit, and asked members of the public to avoid mountain and
coastal areas.</p>
            <p>More than 2,000 tourists were evacuated from Taiwan's Green
Island, near the city of Taitung, on Thursday as a precaution.</p>
            <p>Some flights to Taiwan have been disrupted, with both Cathay
Pacific and China Airlines announcing cancellations or planned
cancellations.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Soulik is expected to arrive in mainland China's eastern
provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang on Saturday.</p>
            <p>Local authorities have been asked to implement emergency
response plans, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported.</p>
            <p>Typhoons are common during the summer in parts of East Asia,
where the warm moist air and low pressure conditions enable
tropical cyclones to form.</p>
