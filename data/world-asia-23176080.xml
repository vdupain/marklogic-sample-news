            <p class="introduction">Campaigning has
kicked off for Japan's upper house elections, which will take place
on 21 July.</p>
            <p>The parliamentary vote will be seen as a referendum on Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and his ruling party.</p>
            <p>Mr Abe currently enjoys high approval ratings, and his Liberal
Democratic Party is expected to do well.</p>
            <p>A conclusive LDP win would end years of parliamentary deadlock.
Currently, opposition parties are able to block government bills in
the upper house.</p>
            <p>The poll will select legislators for half of the 242 seats in
the upper chamber.</p>
            <p>Japan's upper house, while not as powerful as its lower house,
is able to block legislation introduced by the government.</p>
            <p>No one party has a majority, although the opposition Democratic
Party of Japan has the highest number of seats.</p>
            <p>Opposition parties have had enough combined seats to control the
upper chamber in recent years, leading to what has become known as
a "twisted parliament".</p>
            <p>"Because of a twisted parliament, rebuilding has not progressed
speedily, revitalisation of the economy has not progressed
speedily," Mr Abe said on Thursday as he kicked off his party's
campaign.</p>
            <p>Mr Abe has relatively strong public support for his proposals
for economic reform, which have become known as "Abenomics".</p>
            <p>However, he wants Japan's nuclear reactors to be restarted -
something many in Japan are opposed to.</p>
