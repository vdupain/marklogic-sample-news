            <p class="introduction">Insurgents have
killed at least seven people in a suicide attack on the Kabul base
of a logistics firm supplying Nato forces in Afghanistan, police
say.</p>
            <p>Five guards, four of them Nepali, were among those killed in the
gun and bomb attack, which came early on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>The Kabul police chief told the BBC the four insurgents, who
were all killed, had a truck full of explosives.</p>
            <p>This is the latest in a series of attacks on targets in the
Afghan capital in recent months.</p>
            <p>Last week, Afghan security forces put down a militant gun and
bomb attack near the presidential palace, in one of the most secure
areas of Kabul.</p>
            <p>The Taliban say they carried out that attack, in which four
insurgents and three security guards died.</p>
            <p>On Monday, the Afghan intelligence agency said a would-be
suicide bomber had been shot dead in central Kabul.</p>
            <p>In the latest incident, smoke was seen
rising above the scene of the attack in the north of the city.</p>
            <p>Reports suggested the bomber's vehicle was stopped outside the
facility by guards.</p>
            <p>When the explosives were detonated, gunmen began shooting at
guards in a 30-minute battle, officials said.</p>
            <p>As well as the Nepali guards, two Afghan truck drivers who were
waiting to enter the compound were killed and an Afghan guard.</p>
            <p>All four attackers were killed, Kabul police chief Gen Ayub
Salangi said. The blast from the truck left a large crater in the
ground, police said.</p>
            <p>Last month, Afghan forces assumed security responsibility for
the whole of the country for the first time since the Taliban
government was ousted in 2001.</p>
            <p>International troops will remain in Afghanistan until the end of
2014, providing military back-up when needed.</p>
            <p>The US and its Nato allies want the Afghan government to begin
dialogue with the Taliban with a view to opening peace
negotiations.</p>
            <p>But when the Taliban opened a representative office in Qatar -
seen as a possible venue for talks - last month, it prompted an
angry reaction from the Afghan government, which said the office
had the appearance of a rival administration.</p>
            <p>Afghan President Hamid Karzai also says any dialogue process
must be "Afghan-led".</p>
