            <p class="introduction">President Barack
Obama has ruled out diplomatic "wheeling and dealing" in attempts
to extradite US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden.</p>
            <p>Speaking on a visit to the West African nation of Senegal, Mr
Obama said the case would be handled through routine legal
channels.</p>
            <p>"I am not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old
hacker," he added.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said the country
had yet to decide whether to admit Mr Snowden.</p>

looking for Edward Snowden</p>
            </div>
            <p>The former National Security Agency contractor faces espionage
charges in the US. He flew to Moscow last weekend and has requested
asylum in Ecuador.</p>
            <p>"Would he be allowed to arrive on Ecuadoran territory?" Mr
Correa said on Thursday. "This is something that, in principle, we
haven't considered. We would probably examine it, but for now he is
in Russia."</p>
            <p>Mr Obama also said on Thursday that he had not called China's
and Russia's presidents about the case, adding: "I shouldn't have
to."</p>
            <p>He told a news conference in the Senegalese capital Dakar: "I'm
not going to have one case of a suspect who we're trying to
extradite suddenly being elevated to the point where I've got to
start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a whole host of
other issues."</p>
            <p>He added: "My continued expectation is that Russia or other
countries that have talked about potentially providing Mr Snowden
asylum recognise that they are a part of an international community
and they should be abiding by international law."</p>
            <p>The US has accused Russia and China of helping Mr Snowden, which
both deny.</p>
            <p>On Monday, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Ecuador had
issued a special refugee travel document to Mr Snowden, whose US
passport has been revoked.</p>

            </div>
            <p>But a senior Ecuadoran official contradicted that report.</p>
            <p>"We confirm that the government of Ecuador has not authorised
the delivery of any safe passage or refugee document that would
allow Mr Snowden to travel to our country," Political Issues
Minister Betty Tola told reporters, according to AFP news
agency.</p>
            <p>The country also renounced its multi-million dollar trade
relationship with the US, saying its forthcoming renewal would not
influence any decision on Mr Snowden's case.</p>
            <p>"Ecuador will not accept pressures or threats from anyone, and
it does not traffic in its values or allow them to be subjugated to
mercantile interests," said government spokesman Fernando
Alvarado.</p>
            <p>He also made an apparently tongue-in-cheek offer of economic aid
to the US for human rights training.</p>
            <p>The remarks come a day after the chairman of the US Senate
foreign relations committee, Robert Menendez, suggested punishing
Ecuador economically if it offered asylum to Mr Snowden.</p>
            <p>The American is wanted for leaking to media that the US is
systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data under a
surveillance programme known as Prism.</p>
            <p>On Thursday, Beijing accused the US of
"double standards" on cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>China's defence ministry said the Prism programme "has revealed
the concerned country's true face and hypocritical behaviour".</p>
            <p>Mr Snowden, now 30, fled to Hong Kong on 20 May before flying to
Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on Sunday, where Russian authorities
say he remains in a transit zone.</p>
            <p>Although Russia has no extradition treaty with the US,
Washington says it wants Moscow to extradite him without delay.</p>
            <p>Russia denies reports its secret police have questioned Mr
Snowden.</p>
            <p>Hong Kong officials said he had been allowed out of the
territory because of a mistake in the middle name given on US
arrest documents.</p>
            <p>The US justice department dismissed that as a "pretext for not
acting".</p>
