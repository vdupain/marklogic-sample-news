            <p class="introduction">Colombia has
extradited one of the country's most notorious drug lords to the
US, officials have said.</p>
            <p>Daniel Barrera, known as "El Loco" (The Madman), was caught last
year in Venezuela, and sent back to Colombia.</p>
            <p>While on the run he had cosmetic surgery and tried to burn his
fingerprints to conceal his identity.</p>
            <p>He was convicted on drugs charges in Colombia in 1990 but
escaped. He is wanted in the US on charges of drug trafficking and
money laundering.</p>
            <p>At the height of his powers, he is believed to have controlled
smuggling routes from Colombia through Venezuela to Central America
and eventually the US.</p>
            <p>He is thought to have transported hundreds of tonnes of cocaine
and accrued a vast fortune over almost two decades.</p>
            <p>Barrera, now 51, was arrested in Venezuela in September 2012
while making a call in a phone booth.</p>
            <p>He only ever used public telephones to communicate with his
family and allies, in an attempt to avoid his calls being
traced.</p>
            <p>The US had offered $5m (Ã‚Â£3m) for
information leading to his arrest and Colombia added an additional
$2.7m to that reward.</p>
            <p>Colombian national police chief Jose Roberto Leon said Tuesday's
extradition showed other criminals they were better off turning
themselves in.</p>
