naval drills in 2012</span>

            <p class="introduction">China and Russia are
beginning joint naval drills which Beijing has described as the
country's largest with a foreign partner.</p>
            <p>The drills, which are taking place in the Sea of Japan, last
from 5-12 July.</p>
            <p>People's Liberation Army chief Gen Fang Fenghui said on Tuesday
the drills did not "target any third parties", but aimed to deepen
ties with Russia.</p>
            <p>However they come amid tensions with regional neighbours
including Japan and the Philippines over maritime disputes.</p>
            <p>China has overlapping claims with Tokyo and Manila in the East
China and South China Sea respectively - something which has led to
a marked deterioration in ties in recent years as China has pressed
its claim more assertively.</p>
            <p>Last month the US and Japanese navies held joint exercises off
San Diego.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, China's Defence Ministry said the drills
marked the navy's "single biggest deployment of military force in a
China-foreign joint exercise".</p>
            <p>"Assertions have been made that this drill has a symbolic
significance in terms of safeguarding the sovereignty of islands in
the area, and represents a response to the US-Japan alliance,"
Communist Party newspaper People's Daily wrote on Friday.</p>
            <p>But, the paper said, it was part of series of routine exercises,
with the drill focusing on joint escort and the recovery of
kidnapped vessels.</p>
            <p>"There will be no aggressive element to the joint drill," it
said.</p>
            <p>The Chinese fleet comprises four destroyers, two guided missile
frigates and a support ship, Chinese state media say.</p>
            <p>The fleet left its base on Monday in China's Qingdao port for
the Peter the Great Bay in Russia.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Russia is expected to deploy 11 warships, a submarine
and three planes during the drills, reports say.</p>
            <p>China and Russia conducted naval drills for the first time last
year. Both countries have participated in military exercises since
2005.</p>
