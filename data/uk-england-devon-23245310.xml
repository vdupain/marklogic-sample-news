            <p class="introduction">A man who was
involved in a plot to rob and murder soul singer Joss Stone has
been jailed for 18 years.</p>
            <p>Junior Bradshaw, 32, of St Stephen's Close, Manchester, denied
conspiracy to murder and rob her at her home in Ashill, near
Hemyock, Devon, in 2011.</p>
            <p>Both he and Kevin Liverpool, 35, were found guilty at Exeter
Crown Court three months ago.</p>
            <p>Liverpool was jailed in April for life with a minimum term of 10
years and eight months.</p>
            <p>The pair were found with a body bag and a variety of weapons
including a Samurai sword, two hammers and knives.</p>
            <p>Bradshaw was told by the judge at Exeter Crown Court that,
although he has an IQ of just 65, he understood what he was
involved in.</p>
            <p>His sentence had been delayed for psychiatric reports.</p>
            <p>Doctors concluded he had schizophrenia and mental impairment but
did not need hospital treatment.</p>
            <p>He received a shorter sentence than Liverpool after the court
heard how he was "a foot soldier" who was recruited into the plot
by the other man, who was the instigator and mastermind.</p>
            <p>Mr Martin Meeke, QC, defending, said the reports confirmed that
Bradshaw was vulnerable by virtue of his low intelligence which
made him susceptible to being manipulated and influenced by
Liverpool.</p>
