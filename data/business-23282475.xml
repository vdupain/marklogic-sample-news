            <p class="introduction">Shares of Infosys,
India's second-largest software firm, have surged by as much as 12%
after it reported a jump in profits and left its yearly revenue
growth outlook unchanged.</p>
            <p>It made a net profit of 23.8bn rupees ($397m;
Ã‚Â£262m) in the April to June quarter, a 3.7%
jump from a year ago.</p>
            <p>Infosys has struggled in recent months to maintain its growth
rate amid a slowdown in key markets such as the US.</p>
            <p>Last month, it asked its co-founder Narayana Murthy to return as
chairman.</p>
            <p>"This is far better than what some people in the market were
expecting," said Tarun Sisodia a director at Chanakya Niti Pvt
Limited in Mumbai.</p>
            <p>"The earnings have been pretty volatile in the last few quarters
and this time around the expectations were muted given what has
happened in the company recently."</p>
            <p>The company maintained its forecast of 6-10% revenue growth in
the current financial year.</p>
            <p>India's software firms, including
Infosys, have seen their growth rates slow in recent years.</p>
            <p>They have been hurt by an economic slowdown in key markets such
as the US and Europe, which has affected demand.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, Infosys had warned that its profit margins
may remain under pressure amid the challenging global economic
environment, triggering concerns about the firm's health.</p>
            <p>Prompted by the slowdown, the company asked its co-founder, the
66-year old Mr Murthy, to return to the helm.</p>
            <p>Mr Murthy, who had retired two years ago, took charge of the
firm on 1 June for a period of five years.</p>
            <p>Analysts said that investors were betting that his return would
help the firm achieve higher growth rates than it has seen in
recent months.</p>
            <p>"You can ascribe it to Murthy magic," said Phani Sekhar, a fund
manager with Angel Broking in Mumbai.</p>
            <p>"Generally you can conclude that the worst is over for them but
it remains to be seen how quickly they can recover from here."</p>
