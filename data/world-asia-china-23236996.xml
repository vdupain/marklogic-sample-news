gathered to commemorate the Dalai Lama</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Chinese police
opened fire on a group of Tibetans who had gathered to mark the
Dalai Lama's birthday, leaving several people injured, a rights
group and news reports say.</p>
            <p>The incident happened in Daofu in Sichuan province on 6
July.</p>
            <p>Monks and other Tibetans had gathered at a sacred mountain to
mark the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader's birthday with offerings
and incense.</p>
            <p>Police shot into the crowd and used tear gas, the reports
said.</p>
            <p>Beijing does not appear to have commented yet on the incident.
Calls from the BBC to local authorities in Daofu did not connect.
Local officials told AFP and Reuters news agencies that no incident
took place.</p>
            <p>Confirming details about incidents in the region is difficult -
Chinese state media report some but not all. Foreign journalists
are not allowed in and the flow of information is tightly
controlled.</p>
            <p>The International Campaign for Tibet <a href="http://www.savetibet.org/tibetan-monks-shot-as-police-open-fire-on-tibetans-praying-on-dalai-lamas-birthday/">
said in a statement</a> that many of those assembled at the
mountain were monks and nuns.</p>
            <p>"Large numbers of armed police and
soldiers were deployed, with one source reporting at least seven
army trucks and police vehicles at the scene," it said.</p>
            <p>Security personnel attempted to prevent the crowds from making
their offerings, it said.</p>
            <p>"Without warning, according to several Tibetan sources, police
opened fire on the unarmed crowd and used tear gas," it said.</p>
            <p>Two monks were shot in the head and several others injured, the
ICT statement said.</p>
            <p>Phayul, an exile-run news portal, said one monk was in a
critical condition after being shot in the head, with at least four
more "severely injured".</p>
            <p>"They smashed doors and windows of our vehicles and started
beating Tibetans gathered in the area and dispersed the Tibetans
and started shooting at the crowd," an unidentified local resident
was quoted as saying by Radio Free Asia.</p>
            <p>One of those who was shot was the brother of a nun who set
herself on fire in 2011, RFA and Phayul said.</p>
            <p>In recent years more than 110 ethnic Tibetans - mostly young
monks and nuns living in areas outside Tibet - have set themselves
on fire in apparent protest against Beijing's rule.</p>
            <p>Most of the incidents have taken place areas of Sichuan province
with large ethnic Tibetan populations.</p>
            <p>Late last month, the Chinese government issued a strong denial
of reports that its long-standing ban on openly worshipping the
Dalai Lama had changed.</p>
            <p>The move followed reports that restrictions on worshipping the
Dalai Lama had been eased in some areas.</p>
