            <p class="introduction">South Korea has
offered working-level talks with the North on reopening the
jointly-run Kaesong industrial zone.</p>
            <p>Seoul made the proposal a day after Pyongyang said South Korean
officials could visit the closed complex to inspect and maintain
equipment.</p>
            <p>Work at the factory park, which was a rare symbol of North-South
co-operation, was halted in April amid high regional tensions.</p>
            <p>Attempts to hold high-level talks last month failed on
procedural grounds.</p>
            <p>"The government wants talks to be held at the truce village of
Panmunjom," South Korea's Ministry of Unification said in a
statement.</p>
            <p>"Seoul's stance remains consistent and centres on government
authorities resolving all outstanding issues through dialogue."</p>
            <p>It said the offer of talks was made via a North-South hotline
that was cut by Pyongyang in June but has now been restored.</p>
            <p>North Korea has yet to respond to the offer.</p>
            <p>South Korea proposed that the talks take place on Saturday.</p>
            <p>Prior to operations being suspended, there were around 120 South
Korean businesses in the factory park, which had provided the North
with a source of much-needed hard currency.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday, North Korea said it would allow South Korean
companies to enter the complex, which is located just inside North
Korea, to protect their equipment from damage in the rainy
season.</p>
            <p>The offer came after some South Korean
firms threatened to abandon the zone entirely and relocate their
equipment.</p>
            <p>A spokesman representing electronic and machinery makers in
Kaesong had said: "Kaesong must be reopened or [the factories] have
to move elsewhere".</p>
            <p>Pyongyang withdrew its 53,000 workers from the complex in April,
apparently angered by tightened UN sanctions in the wake of its
nuclear test in February, and annual South Korea-US military
drills.</p>
            <p>North Korea also prevented South Korean workers from entering
the joint commercial zone.</p>
            <p>The last South Korean workers left the zone on 3 May.</p>
            <p>In June, officials from North and South Korea agreed to hold
their first high-level government meeting since 2007, focused on
resuming operations at Kaesong industrial park.</p>
            <p>However, the planned talks were suspended after the two sides
disagreed on the composition of the delegations.</p>
            <p>North Korea then proposed high-level talks with the US.</p>
            <p>However, both Washington and Seoul responded coolly to the
offer, with the US saying that Pyongyang would be judged "by its
actions and not its words".</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, South Korea said that it would increase its
cyber-security budget from 5 trillion won ($4.38bn;
Ã‚Â£2.88bn) to 10 trillion won ($8.76bn;
Ã‚Â£5.76bn), and train 5,000 cyber security
experts.</p>
            <p>North Korea has been blamed for previous cyber attacks on South
Korea, including an attack on six South Korean banks and
broadcasters in March that affected 32,000 computers.</p>
