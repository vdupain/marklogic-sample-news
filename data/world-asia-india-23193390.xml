            <p class="introduction">The Indian president
has approved a giant programme to provide subsidised food to
two-thirds of the population.</p>
            <p>Pranab Mukherjee signed into law the food security ordinance
approved by the cabinet two days ago.</p>
            <p>Under the new law, the government will provide 5kg of cheap
grain every month to nearly 800 million poor people.</p>
            <p>The ordinance still has to be ratified by the parliament within
six weeks of its first sitting, otherwise it will lapse,
authorities say.</p>
            <p>Opposition parties have criticised the government for passing
the measure as an ordinance, after failing to win parliamentary
support.</p>
            <p>Critics say the plan is a political move to win votes and will
drain India's finances. Supporters say it will help reduce
poverty.</p>
            <p>The ambitious National Food Security Bill, which will cost 1.3
trillion rupees ($23.9bn; Ã‚Â£15.8bn) a year,
is being called one of the world's largest welfare schemes.</p>
            <p>It was an election promise made by the ruling Congress party and
its implementation is expected to help the party in general
elections due next year.</p>
            <p>But the scheme is intended to combat hunger - despite impressive
economic growth in recent years, India still struggles to feed its
population and has more malnourished children than any other
country in the world.</p>
            <p>The bill proposes to provide a kilo of rice at three rupees (six
cents; four pence), wheat at two rupees and millet at one
rupee.</p>
            <p>The measure will apply to 75% of Indians living in rural areas
and 50% of the urban population.</p>
