            <p class="introduction">The BBC has received
674 complaints over John Inverdale's comments about Wimbledon
champion Marion Bartoli's personal appearance.</p>
            <p>Speaking on Radio 5 live ahead of Saturday's final, he said
Bartoli was "never going to be a looker".</p>
            <p>A statement from the BBC said: "John is one of our most
experienced presenters.</p>
            <p>"The BBC has apologised for the comment made before Saturday's
final, as has John himself. John has also written a personal
apology to Marion Bartoli."</p>
            <p>While chatting on air about Bartoli's technique as a player,
Inverdale said: "I just wonder if her dad, because he has obviously
been the most influential person in her life, did say to her when
she was 12, 13, 14 maybe, 'listen, you are never going to be, you
know, a looker.</p>
            <p>"'You are never going to be somebody like a Sharapova, you're
never going to be 5ft 11, you're never going to be somebody with
long legs, so you have to compensate for that.</p>
            <p>"'You are going to have to be the most dogged, determined
fighter that anyone has ever seen on the tennis court if you are
going to make it', and she kind of is."</p>

            <p>The BBC presenter made an apology at the beginning of Sunday's
coverage of the men's final for his "clumsy" and "ham-fisted"
comments, which he said had "understandably caused something of a
furore".</p>
            <p>He said the point he was trying to make was "the public
perception of tennis players is that they're all six feet-tall
Amazonian athletes".</p>
            <p>"Marion, who is the Wimbledon champion, bucks that trend, and
she is a fantastic example to all young people that it's attitude,
and will and determination together obviously with talent that in
the end gets you to the top," he said.</p>
            <p>"I've apologised to Marion by letter if any offence was caused
and I do hope that we can leave the matter there."</p>
