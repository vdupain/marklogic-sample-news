former President Fidel Castro</span>

            <p class="introduction">Cuban leader Raul
Castro has removed several senior Communists from the party's
powerful Central Committee.</p>
            <p>They include former parliament speaker and foreign minister
Ricardo Alarcon, a close ally of ex-leader Fidel Castro.</p>
            <p>Mr Castro said those leaving had not made any mistakes or
committed any crimes. He said the changes marked a normal course of
events.</p>
            <p>Mr Alarcon, 76, one of Cuba's most visible politicians, had been
a member of the committee since 1992.</p>
            <p>He stepped down as speaker in February.</p>
            <p>Among the four others removed were Jose Miguel Miyar Barruecos,
81, who was secretary of the Council of State for three decades,
and Misael Enamorado, 60, the party chief in Santiago de Cuba.</p>
            <p>Mr Castro played down the significance of the move in comments
broadcast on state television.</p>
            <p>"There's a door you come in through; there's a door you go out,
without it meaning anything negative," he said.</p>
            <p>Raul Castro became Cuba's leader when his elder brother stepped
down in 2008. In February he was elected to a second five-year
term, which he said would be his last.</p>
