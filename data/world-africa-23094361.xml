               <span style="width:224px;">Obama met Mandela in 2005, when he was a US
senator</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">US President Barack
Obama has landed in South Africa, the second stop in his
three-country tour of Africa.</p>
            <p>Mr Obama said earlier he did not expect to see former President
Nelson Mandela, who is critically ill in hospital.</p>
            <p>Leaving Senegal, he told reporters on board Air Force One: "I
don't need a photo op."</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Mr Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela said
the former leader had made "a great improvement" in recent days,
but was "still unwell".</p>
            <p>But she said she felt it would not be right for the US president
to visit Mr Mandela while he was in a critical condition.</p>
            <p>Correspondents say security is tight in the streets near
Mediclinic Heart Hospital in the capital, Pretoria, where the
94-year old is being treated for a lung infection.</p>
            <p>Ministers, politicians, Mr Mandela's physician and family
members were among those visiting the ex-leader on Friday, his 21st
day in hospital.</p>
            <p>Several hundred people earlier took to the streets of Pretoria
in protest against Mr Obama's foreign policy.</p>
            <p>However, the BBC's James Copnall in the city says Mr Obama does
have wide support in South Africa.</p>

               <p class="caption">The BBC's Fergal Keane: "I think Obama's
absolute determination will be not to do anything that is seen as
opportunistic and, above all, intrusive"</p>
            </div>
            <p>Mr Obama's plane landed at a military airbase near Pretoria on
Friday evening. During his stay, he is scheduled to meet President
Jacob Zuma and hold a major speech, correspondents say. He is also
expected to visit Robben Island, where Mr Mandela was imprisoned
for 18 years.</p>
            <p>However Mr Obama said earlier he did not expect to see the
ailing ex-leader during his South African trip.</p>
            <p>"I don't need a photo op," he said aboard Air Force One after
leaving Senegal. "The last thing I want to do is to be in any way
obtrusive at a time when the family is concerned with Nelson
Mandela's condition."</p>
            <p>He went on to say: "I think the main
message we'll want to deliver is not directly to him, but to his
family - is simply profound gratitude for his leadership all these
years, and that the thoughts and prayers of the American people are
with him, his family and his country."</p>
            <p>Officials and many South Africans have praised his decision to
visit South Africa, our correspondent says.</p>
            <p>Mr Obama met Mr Mandela in 2005 when he was still a US senator.
Both men became the first black presidents of their nations and
have received the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
            <p>The US president has described Mr Mandela as a "hero for the
world", whose "legacy will linger on through the ages", and who had
inspired his own activism as a student.</p>

            <p>Earlier on Friday, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela told reporters outside
Mr Mandela's former home in Soweto: "I'm not a doctor but I can say
that from what he was a few days ago there is great improvement,
but clinically he is still unwell."</p>
            <p>She also thanked domestic and international media for their
coverage, but added that some of the reports had caused the family
distress.</p>
            <p>"We had no idea of the love for us out there," she said.</p>
            <p>"There may be problems here and there when some of you get
carried away and talk about our father in the past tense," she
said, adding:</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">A picture of Barack Obama is among the
many goodwill messages left for Nelson Mandela outside the hospital
where he is being treated</span>
            </div>
            <p>"If sometimes we sound bitter, it is because we are dealing with
a difficult situation."</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, Mr Mandela's eldest daughter criticised the
international media camped outside the Mediclinic Heart Hospital,
calling them "vultures".</p>
            <p>There are mixed emotions among the many well-wishers also
gathered outside the hospital, the BBC's Karen Allen reports from
the scene. People are anxious about his health but also want to
express their pride in the man many consider the father of the
nation.</p>
            <p>"There is no sadness here. There is
celebration. He is a giant," 57-year-old Nomhlahla Donry, whose
husband served time with Mr Mandela, told the AFP news agency.</p>
            <p>"We are saying let him live long because we like him and he has
done a lot for us in this world. He's done a lot of amazing things
and we really love Tata," local resident Alfred Makhathini told
Reuters.</p>
            <p>South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) said it
would hold vigils each day that the former leader remained in
hospital, and the distinctive black, green and gold colours of the
party are much in evidence.</p>
            <p>But the party denied it was exploiting the occasion to canvas
for votes ahead of next year's elections.</p>
            <p>"We love our ANC regalia and we have every right to wish Madiba
well," party spokesman Jackson Mthembu said.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, a court in the Eastern Cape has granted an
application brought by the Mandela family to exhume three of his
children and two other relatives and rebury them in the family
cemetery in Qunu, which is where the former leader wants to be
buried, their lawyers say.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says this is one of the
reasons why the family held a meeting earlier this week.</p>
