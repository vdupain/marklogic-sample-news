Madrid's High Court on Thursday, is accused of tax evasion and
money laundering</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A judge has ordered
that Luis Barcenas, the ex-treasurer of Spain's governing Popular
Party (PP), be held without bail until his corruption trial
starts.</p>
            <p>The ruling came after Switzerland informed the court that Mr
Barcenas had transferred money from Swiss accounts to banks in the
US and Uruguay.</p>
            <p>In light of the revelations, prosecutors argued that the
politician was a flight risk.</p>
            <p>Mr Barcenas and his wife deny charges of tax evasion.</p>
            <p>The couple are suspected of falsifying documents on their tax
statements between 2002 and 2006.</p>
            <p>Mr Barcenas is also accused of keeping up to 48m euros
(Ã‚Â£41m) in secret Swiss bank accounts.
Prosecutors allege that some of the funds stem from illegal party
donations or kickbacks.</p>
            <p>But the ex-treasurer has denied this, saying that all of the
money was made through overseas investments, real estate and art
dealings.</p>
            <p>High Court Judge Pablo Ruz handed down his decision after Mr
Barcenas and his wife had been called in to testify on
Thursday.</p>
            <p>Dozens of people heckled the couple outside the court, the
Spanish newspaper El Pais reports.</p>
            <p>In March, prosecutors discovered what they described as unusual
transactions of more than 600,000 euros over a five-year period
relating to bank accounts held by Mr Barcena's wife, Rosalia
Iglesias.</p>
            <p>She has admitted that she was neither working nor receiving a
steady income during that period.</p>
            <p>The case is part of a broader investigation into claims of
alleged illegal financing of the PP. The party, which is led by
Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, has rejected the allegations.</p>
            <p>Mr Barcenas resigned as party treasurer in 2009 after being
implicated in the slush fund case, which has become known as the
Gurtel scandal.</p>
