            <p class="introduction">Residents of Arizona have been mourning the
19 firefighters who were killed battling a ferocious wildfire last
weekend. The Yarnell Hill Fire saw the biggest loss of
firefighters' lives since the 9/11 attacks.</p>
            <p>The road from Prescott to Yarnell would, in normal times, be a
joy to drive along.</p>
            <p>It winds through wooded hills, each turn offering a new vista,
the slopes rich in pine and shrub, and the blue skies stretch away
on a scale that, to European eyes, is spectacular.</p>
            <p>I realise I risk sounding like a spokesman for the Arizona
tourist board.</p>
            <p>But this is genuinely charming country and as we made our way
through it, it was easy to forget, for a moment, what had happened
here, and why we had come.</p>
            <p>Yarnell is the little town where a forest fire raged unchecked
last Sunday and destroyed half of the houses.</p>
            <p>One man who lived there, Pat Bernard, told me how he had moved
his family out but then stayed a little longer himself.</p>
            <p>With his mobile phone, he filmed what looked like the aftermath
of a bombing.</p>
            <p>Under a dark haze, dozens of buildings were alight. That was bad
enough.</p>
            <p>But what Pat did not know at the time was that firefighters,
deployed nearby to create a fire break, found themselves at the
mercy of a shifting wind.</p>
            <p>What should have been a routine operation, of a type they had
carried out at many other places, went horribly wrong and the fire
they had come to stop overwhelmed them. Nineteen were killed.</p>
            <p>Yarnell itself is closed now. The road towards it was so empty
we wondered if we had got lost.</p>

                 alt="Amateur footage shows "/>
               <p class="caption">Pat Bernard's mobile phone footage shows the
scale of the fire's devastation</p>
            </div>
            <p>A small truck was coming the other way so we waved, and the
driver stopped. He was a utility worker, his vehicle carrying
equipment. He looked exhausted.</p>
            <p>I first asked for directions. Just keep going, he said, and you
will come to a police roadblock. He asked where we were from.</p>
            <p>I have to admit that I did wonder whether we really had time to
chat - we were in a hurry with deadlines to meet.</p>
            <p>But the man seemed eager to talk and when I offered some comment
about the terrible news he sighed, painfully.</p>
            <p>He had just come from Yarnell and one of the dead men was the
son of a friend of his. Tears welled up and ran down his cheek.</p>
            <p>I suddenly felt guilty. I was in a rush but he was grieving.</p>
            <div class="caption body-width">

                 alt="Roadblock on the road to Yarnell"/>
            </div>
            <p>The roadblock was the closest we could get to the fire, the
closest we wanted to get, because even from several miles away, we
could see a vast cloud of grey smoke rising into the air.</p>
            <p>The unnerving thing was that while it usually blew to the north,
advancing steadily in one direction, it would sometimes switch and
burn the other way.</p>
            <p>When our camerawoman Maxine Collins used her most powerful lens,
she could pick out a menacing orange line of flame.</p>
            <p>An emergency official confirmed that the fire was still out of
control.</p>
            <p>The disaster has led to a search for explanations - the
heatwave, the months without rain, climate change, cuts to the
budgets for fire prevention.</p>
            <p>I walked into a forest just above Prescott. Twigs snapped
underfoot, dry grass lay on baked earth, and the wind was gusting,
first one way, then another.</p>
            <p>I had heard the word tinderbox used here but only now did it
make sense.</p>
            <p>In Prescott, in a little park near the courthouse, I met Lorri
Canley, an elderly woman out for a morning stroll.</p>
            <p>She was heartbroken, she said, at the loss of so many lives.</p>
            <p>That is what everyone has been saying here. But then Lorri said
something that really struck me.</p>
            <p>"Prescott is ringed by trees", she told me, "we live with the
risk of fire." Prescott always has, with its history as a mining
town and its streets of pretty wooden houses surrounded by an ocean
of forest.</p>
            <p>To lose 19 men at a stroke is devastating enough. But when they
are the very people trained and dedicated to keeping the fires at
bay, that is an altogether greater tragedy.</p>
            <p>A mile away at fire station number seven, where the men were
based, the fence is jammed with flowers and messages.</p>
            <div class="caption body-width">

                 alt="The fence of Fire Station 7 in Prescott, Arizona"/>
            </div>
            <p>I watched a senior police officer march up with a sense of
ceremony to plant a flag.</p>
            <p>At the foot of the fence, 19 simple wooden crosses stand in a
row.</p>
            <p>A Harley Davidson roared up. The rider, in black leather,
climbed off, removed his helmet, shook his pony tail free and then
knelt down to touch the cross labelled Grant.</p>
            <p>He had known Grant McKee since school, he said, shaking his head
in sorrow. He climbed onto his bike but before he put his helmet
back on, he reached up with the back of his hand to dry his
cheeks.</p>
