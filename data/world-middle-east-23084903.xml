detainees is expected next week</span>

            <p class="introduction">Three human rights
organisations have released details of what they call "credible
allegations of torture" of detainees by authorities in the United
Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>
            <p>The groups, including Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, were given
22 letters smuggled out of prison.</p>
            <p>The letters described sleep deprivation and beatings.</p>
            <p>They include some from 94 activists said to be members of an
Islamist organisation, who are on trial.</p>
            <p>The group are charged with plotting to overthrow the United Arab
Emirates government.</p>
            <p>One of the letters described being beaten "with a plastic tube
all over my body."</p>
            <p>It said: "I was tied to a chair and threatened with
electrocution if I didn't talk. I was humiliated and insulted".</p>
            <p>The group - all Emiratis - was arrested in a series of raids
last year and went on trial in February.</p>
            <p>Their families were denied visitation rights during pre-trial
detention which in some cases had lasted for almost a year.</p>
            <p>Legal representation was also severely curtailed according to
the three human rights organisations.</p>
            <p>Among the 94 are two prominent human rights lawyers, as well as
judges, teachers, and student leaders.</p>
            <p>The government alleges that they were part of a secret cell with
links to the Muslim Brotherhood organisation.</p>
            <p>Most of those arrested belong to the conservative religious
society al Islah.</p>
            <p>A decision on the case is expected 2 July in the Federal Supreme
Court in Abu Dhabi.</p>
            <p>If convicted, the activists, including 13 women, face up to 15
years in jail, with no right of appeal.</p>
            <p>The new allegations follow earlier torture claims that human
rights organisations say have not being investigated.</p>
            <p>The authorities have banned foreign media and international
observers from the trial.</p>
            <p>Joe Stork of Human Rights Watch told the BBC that in addition to
the torture issue, "there is a basic fair trial issue.</p>
            <p>"There is no evidence that shows activity of a criminal nature.
Peaceful political dissent should not be criminalised".</p>
            <p>However the UAE Attorney General has insisted that the prisoners
are being "dealt with according to the law".</p>
