El Anatsui is among the pieces on display at the Brooklyn Museum in
New York</span>

            <p class="introduction">With major museums
in London and New York showcasing leading contemporary African
artists this summer, and Angola's recent success at the Biennale in
Venice, is the world of art finally putting Africa on its map?</p>
            <p>Ghanaian sculptor El Anatsui is among the most celebrated
contemporary African artists at the moment.</p>
            <p>Among his most iconic pieces are sculptures made from thousands
of bottle tops, strung together with copper wire to form enormous
shimmering sheets, which undulate and fold into different
shapes.</p>
            <p>Mr Anatsui's installations are currently on display at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York - one of the few solo
exhibitions of an African artist at a big institution in the United
States in the last few decades.</p>
            <p>"El Anatsui's career has taken on a meteoric rise," says Kevin
Dumouchelle the curator of the exhibition.</p>
            <p>"At the beginning he was regarded as the best contemporary
artist in Africa, but he made a leap and has become a global
artist."</p>
            <p>Mr Dumouchelle acknowledges that most visitors are rather
surprised when they see who is on display.</p>
            <p>"There is definitely a sense of catching up," he says.</p>
            <p>And Mr Anatsui is not only being celebrated in New York, but
also across the Atlantic in the UK.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">A Vision of the Tomb by Sudanese
politician turned painter Ibrahim El-Salahi</span>
            </div>
            <p>Following an invitation from the Royal Academy in London, he has
created a large wall-hanging sculpture for the duration of this
year's summer exhibition.</p>
            <p>The installation in London coincides with several exhibitions
this summer of other contemporary African artists at Tate Modern -
one of the leading contemporary art museums in the world.</p>
            <p>The museum is preparing for the first
major retrospective of Sudanese painter Ibrahim El-Salahi, as well
as a special installation of the works of Meschac Gaba from
Benin.</p>
            <p>Tate acquired Mr Gaba's work as part of its drive to expand
their existing collection with pieces by African artists.</p>
            <p>"Historically Tate's international collection concentrated on
art from Western Europe and North America," says Kerryn Greenberg,
one of the curators at Tate specialising in art from Africa.</p>
            <p>She says the new acquisitions acknowledge that some of the most
dynamic and important works of art are being created in Africa.</p>
            <p>"There does appear to be a growing interest in African art,
especially in the UK. African artists are becoming increasingly
mobile and visible and exhibiting internationally."</p>
            <p>Tate's decision to expand their collection of African art was
noted among curators as well as private collectors, and is widely
seen to have contributed substantially to the current buzz about
African art.</p>
            <p>Bonhams in London is the only auction house with an annual sale
dedicated to contemporary African art - the first auction was five
years ago.</p>
            <p>"After years of having to push at closed doors, the recent sale
in May felt like a breakthrough," says Giles Peppiatt, director of
Bonhams' African Art department.</p>
            <p>According to Mr Peppiatt there was a lot of interest from
museums and private buyers in Europe and the United States, but
also from Africa, especially Nigeria.</p>
            <p>"People are much more interested in Africa commercially. The
continent is seen as the next big thing, and there is an enormous
amount of wealth among Africans."</p>
            <p>Compared to contemporary art from other parts of the world, the
prices for African art are still quite modest, and investors are
seeing it increasingly as a good investment.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Flag by Meschac Gaba will be on display at Tate
Modern from July</span>
            </div>
            <p>"Public museums don't have lots of money, so their curators have
to look over the hill and see what might be the next big thing,"
says Mr Peppiatt.</p>
            <p>Africa's increasing presence on the international art market
helped Koyo Kouoh - a Cameroonian-born curator - to secure funding
for the first contemporary fair for African art in London later
this year.</p>
            <p>She says the idea has been in the pipeline for years, but the
increased focus on African art internationally and the increased
prominence of African art professionals made all the
difference.</p>
            <p>"We have corporate sponsors from Africa as well as philanthropic
funding from Europe. Everything is coming together."</p>
            <p>Ms Kouoh has just returned from the
Venice Biennale - one the world's most important events for
international contemporary art.</p>
            <p>A record number of African countries are represented at the
biennale this year and Angola managed to secure the award for the
best national pavilion, the first African country to ever win the
prize.</p>
            <p>"It changes the perception of Angola. The focus is not just on
war anymore," she says.</p>
            <p>"The award is praise for Angola but also for Africa. African
countries are getting more and more involved in promoting art and
they are using art to promote their country."</p>
            <p>Works by Edson Chagas, a 36-year-old photographer based in
Luanda, were the pavilion's showpiece.</p>
            <p>"It was a huge surprise," says Mr Chagas, "especially because it
was the first time we were participating."</p>
            <p>Born in Angola during the civil war, he was sent abroad by his
parents when he was 15.</p>

                 alt="Edson Chagas "/>
               <span style="width:624px;">Edson Chagas believes his award will spark interest
in works by other contemporary Angolan artists</span>
            </div>
            <p>Later on he studied photography in Europe - in the UK as well as
in Portugal.</p>
            <p>"There was no art school in my country so I decided to go to
London. But my goal was always to come back to Angola," says Mr
Chagas.</p>
            <p>"I really believe that after winning this award there will be
more interest in my work and the works of other contemporary
artists from Angola."</p>
            <p>Mr Chagas also hopes that the international recognition will
prompt the government to use some of the country's petrodollars to
fund the next generation of Angolan artists, so that they can be
educated in the country.</p>
            <p>"Bursaries are the first step, but we also need money to create
spaces so we can reflect on our country and its history."</p>
            <p>Until recently many African artists struggled to secure funding
and recognition, but with the buzz about contemporary African art
among museums and private collectors, Mr Chagas and fellow artists
might finally be lucky.</p>
