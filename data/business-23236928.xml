               <span style="width:304px;">The Lloyd's building is widely regarded
as one of the most iconic properties in London</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">China's Ping An
Insurance Group has agreed to buy the Lloyd's building in London
for Ã‚Â£260m ($388m).</p>
            <p>The building, a landmark property in London and home to the
world's leading insurance market, was owned by German asset
management fund Commerz Real.</p>
            <p>Chinese firms have been looking to buy assets in key markets in
their quest to expand their presence globally.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, Dalian Wanda Group, a Chinese property
developer, announced a Ã‚Â£1bn investment in
the UK.</p>
            <p>Jon Crossfield, a director with Savills which advised on the
Lloyd's of London building deal, said that it was "a potentially
landmark transaction, given it is the first by a Chinese Insurance
company overseas".</p>
            <p>"It is a high profile and confident entry to the market for them
and further illustrates the dominance of overseas investors in
London at present."</p>
            <p>Though Savills did not name the buyer <a href="http://www.savills.co.uk/_news/newsitem.aspx?intSitePageId=72418&amp;intNewsSitePageId=169155-0&amp;intNewsMonth=7&amp;intNewsYear=2013">
in its statement</a>, various reports, including that from <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/business/2013-07/08/c_132522992.htm">
China's state-owned Xinhua news agency</a> said that it was Ping An
Insurance.</p>
            <p>The Lloyd's building is known for its innovative design, which
includes the placement of features such as lifts and service pipes
on the exterior of the building, giving it a futuristic look.</p>
            <p>It was designed by renowned architect Richard Rogers and opened
in 1986.</p>
            <p>Commerz Real, which had bought building in 2005 for $231m said
the "current liquidity and investor demand within the London market
presented an ideal time for us to seek an exit in line with our
original business plan".</p>
            <p>"We are delighted with the transaction and it has been a major
success for our investors," said Roland Holschuh, a member of the
management board of Commerz Real.</p>
            <p>Chinese companies have announced two other huge investments in
the London real estate market this year.</p>
            <p>In May, Chinese developer Advanced Business Park (ABP) signed an
agreement worth Ã‚Â£1bn to transform the Royal
Albert Dock in east London into a business port.</p>
            <p>Last month, Dalian Wanda Group said it will invest
Ã‚Â£700m to develop a five-star hotel in
London - the first such development to be operated by a Chinese
firm overseas.</p>
            <p>Wanda also agreed to pay Ã‚Â£320m for
almost 92% of Sunseeker International, famous for providing yachts
for James Bond movies.</p>
