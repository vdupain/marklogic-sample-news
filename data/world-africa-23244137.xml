            <p class="introduction">Veteran of the fight
against apartheid Tokyo Sexwale has been sacked as housing minister
by South African President Jacob Zuma.</p>
            <p>Mr Sexwale is one of several ministers to lose their jobs in
what Mr Zuma said was a strategy to improve the delivery of
government services.</p>
            <p>Analysts, however, note that Mr Sexwale was reportedly involved
in a campaign to oust the president last year.</p>
            <p>He was imprisoned on Robben Island alongside Nelson Mandela.</p>
            <p>He is also a senior official with Fifa, football's world
governing body.</p>
            <p>News that Mr Sexwale, a wealthy businessman, has been relieved
of his duties has long been anticipated in South Africa, says the
BBC Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg.</p>
            <p>He is believed to have been the mastermind of campaign to remove
Mr Zuma in the run-up to the ANC's elective conference in December
2012.</p>
            <p>At the time he had been a vocal critic of the president and also
threw his name into the hat as a possible candidate to replace Mr
Zuma.</p>
