            <p class="introduction">As many as a million
young people in Japan are thought to remain holed up in their homes
- sometimes for decades at a time. Why?</p>
            <p>For Hide, the problems started when he gave up school.</p>
            <p>"I started to blame myself and my parents also blamed me for not
going to school. The pressure started to build up," he says.</p>
            <p>"Then, gradually, I became afraid to go out and fearful of
meeting people. And then I couldn't get out of my house."</p>
            <p>Gradually, Hide relinquished all communication with friends and
eventually, his parents. To avoid seeing them he slept through the
day and sat up all night, watching TV.</p>
            <p>"I had all kinds of negative emotions inside me," he says. "The
desire to go outside, anger towards society and my parents, sadness
about having this condition, fear about what would happen in the
future, and jealousy towards the people who were leading normal
lives."</p>
            <p>Hide had become "withdrawn" or <em>hikikomori</em>.</p>
            <p>In Japan, hikikomori, a term that's also used to describe the
young people who withdraw, is a word that everyone knows.</p>
            <p>Tamaki Saito was a newly qualified
psychiatrist when, in the early 1990s, he was struck by the number
of parents who sought his help with children who had quit school
and hidden themselves away for months and sometimes years at a
time. These young people were often from middle-class families,
they were almost always male, and the average age for their
withdrawal was 15.</p>
            <p>It might sound like straightforward teenage laziness. Why not
stay in your room while your parents wait on you? But Saito says
sufferers are paralysed by profound social fears.</p>
            <p>"They are tormented in the mind," he says. "They want to go out
in the world, they want to make friends or lovers, but they
can't."</p>
            <p>Symptoms vary between patients. For some, violent outbursts
alternate with infantile behaviour such as pawing at the mother's
body. Other patients might be obsessive, paranoid and
depressed.</p>
            <p>When Saito began his research, social
withdrawal was not unknown, but it was treated by doctors as a
symptom of other underlying problems rather than a pattern of
behaviour requiring special treatment.</p>
            <p>Since he drew attention to the phenomenon, it is thought the
numbers of hikikomori have increased. A conservative estimate of
the number of people now affected is 200,000, but a 2010 survey for
the Japanese Cabinet Office came back with a much higher figure -
700,000. Since sufferers are by definition hidden away, Saito
himself places the figure higher still, at around one million.</p>
            <p>The average age of hikikomori also seems to have risen over the
last two decades. Before it was 21 - now it is 32.</p>
            <p>So why do they withdraw?</p>
            <p>The trigger for a boy retreating to his bedroom might be
comparatively slight - poor grades or a broken heart, for example -
but the withdrawal itself can become a source of trauma. And
powerful social forces can conspire to keep him there.</p>
            <p>One such force is <em>sekentei</em>, a person's reputation in
the community and the pressure he or she feels to impress others.
The longer hikikomori remain apart from society, the more aware
they become of their social failure. They lose whatever self-esteem
and confidence they had and the prospect of leaving home becomes
ever more terrifying.</p>
            <p>Parents are also conscious of their social standing and
frequently wait for months before seeking professional help.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Welcome to NHK! was a novel, comic book and cartoon
that focused on the life of a hikikomori</span>
            </div>
            <p>A second social factor is the <em>amae</em> - dependence - that
characterises Japanese family relationships. Young women
traditionally live with their parents until marriage - men may
never move out of the family home. Even though about half of
hikikomori are violent towards their parents, for most families it
would be unthinkable to throw them out.</p>
            <p>But in exchange for decades of support for their children,
parents expect them to show respect and fulfil their role in
society of getting a job.</p>
            <p>Matsu became hikikomori after he fell out with his parents about
his career and university course.</p>
            <p>"I was very well mentally, but my parents
pushed me the way I didn't want to go," he says. "My father is an
artist and he runs his own business - he wanted me to do the same."
But Matsu wanted to become a computer programmer in a large firm -
one of corporate Japan's army of "salarymen".</p>
            <p>"But my father said: 'In the future there won't be a society
like that.' He said: 'Don't become a salaryman.'"</p>
            <p>Like many hikikomori, Matsu was the eldest son and felt the full
weight of parental expectation. He grew furious when he saw his
younger brother doing what he wanted. "I became violent and had to
live separately from my family," he says.</p>
            <p>One way to interpret Matsu's story is see him as being at the
faultline of a cultural shift in Japan.</p>
            <p>"Traditionally, Japanese psychology was thought to be
group-oriented - Japanese people do not want to stand out in a
group," says Yuriko Suzuki, a psychologist at the National
Institute for Mental Health in Tokyo. "But I think especially for
the younger generation, they want more individualised or
personalised care and attention. I think we are in a mixed
state."</p>
            <p>But even hikikomori who desperately want to fulfil their
parents' plans for them may find themselves frustrated.</p>
            <p>Andy Furlong, an academic at the University of Glasgow
specialising in the transition from education to work, connects the
growth of the hikikomori phenomenon with the popping of the 1980s
"bubble economy" and the onset of Japan's recession of the
1990s.</p>
            <p>It was at this point that the conveyor belt of good school
grades leading to good university places leading to jobs-for-life
broke down. A generation of Japanese were faced with the insecurity
of short-term, part-time work.</p>
            <p>And it came with stigma, not sympathy.</p>
            <p>Job-hopping Japanese were called "freeters" - a combination of
the word "freelance" and the German word for "worker",
<em>arbeiter</em>. In political discussion, freeters were
frequently bundled together with "neets" - an adopted British
acronym meaning "not in education, employment or training". Neets,
freeters, hikikomori - these were ways of describing the
good-for-nothing younger generation, parasites on the flagging
Japanese economy. The older generation, who graduated and slotted
into steady careers in the 1960s and 1970s, could not relate to
them.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">University graduates at a job-hunting fair in
February... but freeters, neets and hikikomori find themselves on
the periphery of Japan's labour market</span>
            </div>
            <p>"The opportunities have changed fundamentally," says Furlong. "I
don't think the families always know how to handle that."</p>
            <p>A common reaction is for parents to treat their recalcitrant son
with anger, to lecture them and make them feel guilty for bringing
shame on the family. The risk here is that - as with Hide -
communication with parents may break down altogether. But some
parents have been driven to extreme measures.</p>
            <p>For a time one company operating in Nagoya could be hired by
parents to burst into their children's rooms, give them a big
dressing down, and forcibly drag them away to a dormitory to learn
the error of their ways.</p>
            <p>Kazuhiko Saito, the director of the psychiatry department at
Kohnodai Hospital in Chiba, says that sudden interventions - even
by healthcare professionals - can prove disastrous.</p>
            <p>"In many cases, the patient becomes violent towards the staff or
the parents in front of the counsellors, or after the counsellors
have left," he says.</p>
            <p>Kazuhiko Saito is in favour of healthcare professionals visiting
hikikomori, but he says they must be fully briefed on the patient,
who must know in advance that they are coming.</p>
            <p>In any case, the do-nothing approach has
been shown not to work. Tamaki Saito likens the hikikomori state to
alcoholism, in that it is impossible to give up without a support
network.</p>
            <p>His approach is to begin with "reorganising" the relationship
between the patient and his parents, arming desperate mothers and
fathers with strategies to restart communication with their
children. When the patient is well enough to come to the clinic in
person he can be treated with drugs and therapy. Group therapy is a
relatively new concept to Japanese psychology, but self-help groups
have become a key way of drawing hikikomori into wider society.</p>
            <p>For both Hide and Matsu, the journey to recovery was helped by
visiting a charity-run youth club in Tokyo known as an
<em>ibasho</em> - a safe place for visitors to start reintroducing
themselves to society.</p>
            <p>Both men have made progress in their relationships with their
parents. Matsu has been for a job interview as a computer
programmer, and Hide has a part-time job. He thinks that by
starting to talk again with his parents, the whole family has been
able to move on.</p>
            <p>"They thought about their way of life in the past and in the
future," he says. "I think that before - even though they were out
working - their mental attitude was just like a hikikomori, but now
they're more open and honest with themselves. So as their child I'm
very happy to see them change."</p>
            <p>Many parents of hikikomori visit the ibasho even though their
children may never be well enough to come with them.</p>
            <p>Yoshiko's son withdrew from society very gradually when he was
22.</p>
            <p>At first he would go out to buy shopping, but she observes
ruefully that internet shopping means this is no longer necessary
and he no longer leaves the house. He is now 50 years old.</p>
            <p>"I think my son is losing the power or desire to do what he
wants to do," she says. "Maybe he used to have something he wanted
to do but I think I ruined it."</p>

<em>otaku</em> are "geeks" or "nerds"</li>
               <li>They are known for their obsessions, especially manga cartoons
and anime</li>
               <li>"Otaku" is the formal word for "you" in Japanese - it's thought
that the term came about from the tendency of socially awkward
manga fans to use over-formal language</li>
               <li>In press coverage, both otaku and hikikomori have been linked
with serious sex crimes</li>

males occupy 70%- 80% of the group</li>
               <li>However, an internet survey by NHK found just 53% to be
male</li>
               <li>Andy Furlong at the University of Glasgow speculates that
female withdrawal into the home seems so natural to Japanese
society that women hikikomori may remain unreported</li>

Japan: abnormal avoidance of social contact"</li>

Italy</li>
               <li>After a 2002 BBC documentary, Saito received a flurry of emails
from British parents who said their children were in a similar
condition</li>
               <li>Andy Furlong points out that young people in Western societies
frequently "take time out" in gap years or have "false starts" on
careers or courses without attracting stigma</li>
               <li>He adds that the preconditions for a hikikomori-like problem
are falling into place in Europe, with 50% youth unemployment in
some countries, forcing young people to continue living at
home</li>
