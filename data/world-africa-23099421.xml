               <span style="width:304px;">Disputes over cattle and pasture often raise ethnic
tensions in parts of Nigeria</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Gunmen in central
Nigeria have attacked three villages killing at least 28 residents
in a feud over cattle, a military spokesman has told the BBC.</p>
            <p>Capt Salisu Mustapha said the security forces responded, killing
20 gunmen.</p>
            <p>He said Fulani herdsmen were thought to be behind the attack on
the Taroh community in Plateau state after hundreds of their cattle
were stolen.</p>
            <p>Two villages in a nearby Fulani and Hausa community were
subsequently burnt and the residents had fled, he said.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Ishaq Khalid in Jos, the capital of Plateau state,
says disputes over cattle and pasture often raise ethnic
tensions.</p>
            <p>But an attack of such ferocity is unusual in the remote area,
which is about 240km (150 miles) south of Jos, he says.</p>
            <p>A Fulani spokesman in the area denied the military's allegations
that the mainly Muslim community was involved in the attack.</p>
            <p>Sanihu Jauro said that about 1,000 head of cattle had been
stolen earlier this week from Fulani herdsmen and repeated
complaints to the authorities had failed to elicit help.</p>

            </div>
            <p>About 500 cattle had been recovered by the community, but the
rest were still missing, he told the BBC Hausa Service.</p>
            <p>However, the authorities say they are making efforts to recover
the animals.</p>
            <p>The villages of Karkashi, Bolgang and Magama, which came under
attack from the gunmen on Thursday, are populated by mainly
Christian Taroh.</p>
            <p>Mark Lipdo, from the Christian charity Stefanos Foundation, told
Nigeria's Leadership newspaper that the attackers followed their
victims on motorbikes as they tried to escape.</p>
            <p>Capt Mustapha said the security forces sent reinforcements to
the area after the attack, which lasted for several hours.</p>
            <p>He said two gunmen involved in the attacks had been
arrested.</p>
            <p>It was not clear how many homes had been burnt in what looked
like a retaliatory attack on the neighbouring villages of Yamini
and Ajikam, populated by mainly Hausa and Fulani people, or if
anyone was hurt, the army spokesman said.</p>
