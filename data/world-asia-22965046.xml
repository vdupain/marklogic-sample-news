office, which opened in Qatar's capital Doha on
Tuesday</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Afghanistan has
suspended talks with the US to discuss the nature of US military
presence after foreign troops withdraw in 2014.</p>
            <p>A spokesman for President Hamid Karzai said the decision was
taken over "contradictions" in the US proposal of direct talks with
the Taliban.</p>
            <p>Mr Karzai also ruled out talking to the Taliban until the peace
process was "Afghan-led".</p>
            <p>Earlier, four US soldiers died in a Taliban attack at an Afghan
air base.</p>
            <p>A spokesman for the Taliban said the militants had launched two
rockets at Bagram airbase, the largest military base for US troops
in Afghanistan.</p>
            <p>The attack came just hours after the US announced it would open
direct talks with the Taliban at their office in the Qatari
capital, Doha.</p>
            <p>A condition for the talks was for the Taliban to renounce
violence. However, US President Barack Obama did not make a
ceasefire part of the preliminary negotiations.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Jonathan Beale says the Afghan
government clearly thinks that US preconditions should have
included a commitment to talk to the Afghan government, to
acknowledge the constitution of Afghanistan and to renounce
violence.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, President Obama said he always expected "friction" at
Afghan peace talks.</p>
            <p>"My hope is that despite those challenges the process will
proceed," he said during an official visit to Berlin on
Wednesday.</p>
            <p>"Ultimately we're going to need to see Afghans talking to
Afghans about how they can move forward and end the cycle of
violence so they can start actually building their country".</p>
            <p>Afghanistan's National Security Council confirmed President
Karzai had suspended the fourth round of the bilateral security
agreement talks.</p>
            <p>"There is a contradiction between what the US government says
and what it does regarding Afghanistan peace talks," the
president's spokesman Aimal Faizi said.</p>
            <p>He added that the president disagreed with the name given to the
new Taliban office opened on Tuesday in the Qatari capital,
Doha.</p>
            <p>"We oppose the title the 'Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan'
because such a thing doesn't exist," Mr Faizi said.</p>
            <p>"The US was aware of the president's stance."</p>
            <p>Afghan officials said Mr Karzai also objected to the Taliban
flag flying over the new premises.</p>
            <p>The announcement comes a day after Nato handed over the security
for the whole of the country to the Afghan government for the first
time since the Taliban were ousted in 2001.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Bilal Sarwary says President
Karzai has been reluctant to sign a long-term agreement with the US
amid fears it would undermine Afghan sovereignty - and how it might
reflect on him during his remaining time in office.</p>
            <p>US officials told reporters on Tuesday that the first formal
meeting between US and Taliban representatives was expected to take
place in Doha on Thursday.</p>
            <p>On the same day, President Karzai said he also intended to send
delegates of Afghanistan's High Peace Council (HPC) to Doha to
engage in talks with the Taliban in the coming days.</p>
            <p>But there are now questions whether the HPC, set up specifically
to deal with the Taliban, will still go to Doha, correspondents
say.</p>
            <p>In the past, the Taliban have always refused to meet President
Karzai or his government, dismissing them as puppets of
Washington.</p>
            <p>Mr Karzai has expressed anger at previous US and Qatari efforts
to kick-start the peace process without properly consulting his
government, correspondents say.</p>
            <p>There is also concern within the presidential palace that the
Taliban will use the office in Qatar to raise funds.</p>
            <p>The US has previously tried to negotiate with the Taliban, but
never held direct talks.</p>
            <p>In March 2012 the Taliban said it had suspended preliminary
negotiations with Washington, citing US efforts to involve the
Afghan government as a key stumbling block.</p>
            <p>The Taliban set up a diplomatic presence in Qatar in January
2012 and US officials held preliminary discussions there.</p>

            <p>President Karzai clearly feels a sense of anger and betrayal
over the way the US made that announcement. He thought there would
be a commitment from the Taliban to engage with the Afghan
government, to recognise the constitution and to renounce
violence.</p>
            <p>None of those promises were made. Hopes that these talks with
the Taliban will go very far must be fading fast. Without the
involvement of the Afghan government there is no peace process.</p>
            <p>Already tense relations with the US and President Karzai have
reached a new low with the suspension of the negotiations of the
Bilateral Security Agreement.</p>
            <p>On top of that the Taliban have given no indication that the
fighting will end - carrying out an attack on the US military base
in Bagram within hours of what was supposed to be an "important
first step" towards reconciliation.</p>

                  <strong>Independent candidate Hasht-e Sobh</strong>: "With the
opening of an office in Qatar, the Taliban have appeared both in
the military and political fields against the Afghan
government."</li>

                  <strong>National Front spokesman Faizollah Zak</strong>i: "The
office cannot play the role of a kind of embassy. The inauguration
of the office cannot be at the cost of the legitimacy of the
