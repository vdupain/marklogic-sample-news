Strangler's murders</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">US authorities say
DNA evidence links a dead convict long suspected to have been a
notorious serial killer to a woman murdered nearly 50 years
ago.</p>
            <p>The remains of Albert DeSalvo, who confessed to the Boston
Strangler murders, will be exhumed and compared to DNA from the
body of Mary Sullivan.</p>
            <p>DNA from DeSalvo's nephew matches a sample found on her body,
police say.</p>
            <p>Authorities say that "familial" match is the first hard evidence
DeSalvo was the Boston Strangler.</p>
            <p>Sullivan, strangled in her flat in 1964 at age 19, was suspected
- but never proven - to be the Strangler's last victim.</p>
            <p>DeSalvo, a married father and military veteran, confessed to
killing 11 victims attributed to the Boston Strangler, as well as
to two other killings.</p>
            <p>But he was never convicted of them. Instead, he was sentenced to
life in prison over a series of armed robberies and sexual
assaults.</p>

               <p class="caption">Conley said the DNA evidence would "prove"
DeSalvo's guilt</p>
            </div>
            <p>He recanted his confession to the killings before he was stabbed
to death in prison in 1973.</p>
            <p>Law enforcement officials in Boston have long debated whether
DeSalvo was in fact responsible for all of the murders to which he
confessed.</p>
            <p>But now, authorities say tests of a DNA sample taken
surreptitiously from a water bottle from which DeSalvo's nephew had
drunk is a 99.9% match with DNA retrieved from Sullivan's body and
from the blanket on which her body was found.</p>
            <p>Suffolk County, Massachusetts, District Attorney Daniel Conley
said he expected tests on DeSalvo's remains would show an exact
match.</p>
            <p>"For almost five decades, the only link between Albert DeSalvo
and Mary Sullivan's murder was his confession," Mr Conley told
reporters.</p>
            <p>"That confession has been the subject of scepticism and
controversy from almost the moment it was given.</p>
            <p>"These developments give us a glimmer of hope that there can be
one day finality, if not accountability, for the families of the
ten other women murdered so cruelly in Boston, Cambridge, Lawrence,
Lynn and Salem."</p>

               <span style="width:226px;">Mary Sullivan, shown in a photo held by
her sister and nephew, is the only victim with DNA linked to her
case</span>
            </div>
            <p>DeSalvo's relatives say they are furious police tracked
DeSalvo's nephew. And Elaine Sharp, a lawyer for DeSalvo's family,
says her clients believe that even if there is a 100% match there
is still room for doubt.</p>
            <p>The lawyer added that private tests revealed other male DNA on
Sullivan's body that did not match DeSalvo's.</p>
            <p>Officials emphasised that the DNA tests only link DeSalvo to
Sullivan's murder. There is no other DNA known to exist for the
other victims' cases.</p>
            <p>For many years, Sullivan's nephew Casey Sherman believed that
DeSalvo was not his aunt's killer, and even wrote a book exploring
other possible suspects.</p>
            <p>But he said he found the new evidence to be overwhelming.</p>
