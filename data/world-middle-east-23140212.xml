            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Egyptian President
Mohammed Morsi says he was not consulted by the army before it set
a 48-hour ultimatum to resolve the country's deadly crisis.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi said a part of the statement "may cause confusion in
the complex national scene". He vowed to stick to his "national
reconciliation" plan.</p>
            <p>The army has warned it will intervene if the government and its
opponents fail to heed "the will of the people".</p>
            <p>However, it denies that the ultimatum amounts to a coup.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Egypt's state news agency Mena reported early on
Tuesday that Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr had submitted his
resignation.</p>
            <p>If accepted, he would join at least five other ministers who
have already reportedly resigned over the political crisis.</p>
            <p>On Sunday, millions rallied nationwide, urging the president to
step down.</p>
            <p>Large protests continued on Monday with
activists storming and ransacking Cairo's Muslim Brotherhood
headquarters - the group from which the president hails.</p>
            <p>President Morsi's opponents accuse him of putting the
Brotherhood's interests ahead of the country's as a whole.</p>
            <p>He became Egypt's first Islamist president on 30 June 2012,
after winning an election considered free and fair following the
2011 revolution that toppled Hosni Mubarak.</p>
            <p>US President Barack Obama - currently on a tour of Africa -
called Mr Morsi to encourage him to respond to the protesters'
concerns.</p>
            <p>Mr Obama "underscored that the current crisis can only be
resolved through a political process," the White House said in a
statement".</p>
            <p>In an announcement read out on Egyptian TV, Gen Abdel Fattah
al-Sisi, defence minister and head of the armed forces, described
the protests as an "unprecedented" expression of the popular
will.</p>
            <p>If the people's demands were not met, he said, the military
would have to take responsibility for a plan for the future.</p>
            <p>But while he said the army would not get involved in politics or
government, his words were seen by many as a coup in the
making.</p>
            <p>Noisy celebrations erupted in Cairo as protesters interpreted
the army's ultimatum as spelling the end of Mr Morsi's rule.</p>
            <p>Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters of Tamarod (Rebel) -
the opposition movement behind the protests - partied in Cairo's
Tahrir Square late into the night.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile senior Brotherhood figure
Mohammed al-Beltagi urged pro-Morsi supporters to "call their
families in all Egyptian governorates and villages to be prepared
to take to the streets and fill squares" to support their
president.</p>
            <p>"Any coup of any sort will only pass over our dead bodies," he
said to a roar from thousands gathered outside the Rabaa al-Adawiya
mosque in Cairo's Nasr district.</p>
            <p>There were reports of gun clashes between rival factions in the
city of Suez, east of the capital, on Monday night.</p>
            <p>The army later issued a second statement on its Facebook page
emphasising that it "does not aspire to rule and will not overstep
its prescribed role".</p>
            <p>According to Tuesday's presidential statement, President Morsi
was not consulted ahead of the ultimatum announcement. It said that
such action "may cause confusion in the complex national
scene".</p>
            <p>"The presidency asserts that the presidency is going on in its
pre-planned path to hold a comprehensive national reconciliation,"
the presidency statement said.</p>
            <p>Given the inability of politicians from all sides to agree until
now, the 48-hour ultimatum makes it unlikely Mr Morsi can survive
in power, says the BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Cairo.</p>
            <p>The opposition movement had given Mr Morsi until Tuesday
afternoon to step down and call fresh presidential elections, or
else face a campaign of civil disobedience.</p>
            <p>On Saturday, the group said it had collected more than 22
million signatures - more than a quarter of Egypt's population - in
support.</p>

            <p>And on Monday the ministers of tourism, environment,
communication, water utilities and legal affairs reportedly
resigned in an act of "solidarity with the people's demand to
overthrow the regime".</p>
            <p>But Mr Morsi was defiant in an interview published on Sunday,
rejecting calls for early presidential elections.</p>

            <p>The statement by the minister of defence and army chief, Gen
al-Sisi, was worded carefully.</p>
            <p>It did not say the president must go. The army, with troops in
strategic positions across Cairo, is saying the government and
opposition have 48 hours to agree a way forward or it will
intervene with its own plan.</p>
            <p>The Egyptian military has been both hero and villain for the
people involved in the ousting of President Mubarak in 2011.</p>
            <p>Heroes, first of all, when they put themselves between
protesters and the Mubarak regime's enforcers. But later they were
widely criticised for holding onto power for too long.</p>
            <p>The reality is they have never given up their critical role
behind the scenes, which includes huge economic power.</p>
            <p>No matter which way Egypt goes - and there could be some very
rough days ahead - the army will never want its own power
diluted.</p>
