            <p class="introduction">British Airways has
become the first airline in the UK to take delivery of an Airbus
A380 superjumbo.</p>
            <p>The plane landed at Heathrow airport this morning, and is the
first of 12 superjumbos ordered by BA. The planes will carry 469
passengers each.</p>
            <p>The A380's arrival follows the delivery last week of two Boeing
Dreamliner aircraft. BA is currently spending
Ã‚Â£10bn to upgrade its long-haul fleet.</p>
            <p>The first commercial flights are due to begin in autumn
2013.</p>
            <p>The Airbus A380 is the world's largest passenger plane. BA has
orders for 12 A380s and 42 Dreamliners to be delivered over the
next 10 years. It also has bought six new Boeing 777-300ERs and 18
Airbus A350 aircraft.</p>
            <p>Singapore Airlines was the first carrier to operate an A380,
with its first flight taking place in October 2007. Virgin Atlantic
is due to take the first of the six A380s it has ordered in
2018.</p>
            <p>Problems emerged with the A380 in 2012, when hairline cracks
appeared on some of the brackets used to link the wing to the
plane. Each A380 has 4,000 of these brackets and the problem cost
Airbus more than 250m euros in repair and service costs.</p>
