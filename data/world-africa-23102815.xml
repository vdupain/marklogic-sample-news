            <p class="introduction">South African
athlete Oscar Pistorius has resumed training, weeks before he is
due back in court over the killing of his girlfriend.</p>
            <p>His family has released footage showing the Olympic runner
jogging on a track.</p>
            <p>A <a href="http://oscarpistorius.com/oscar-to-return-to-low-key-track-routine/"
               title="Oscar Pistorius statement">statement on his website</a> said
the "low-key routine" was not "a formal return to athletics", but a
way of helping him "process his trauma".</p>
            <p>Mr Pistorius denies murdering Reeva Steenkamp, saying he shot
her after mistaking her for an intruder.</p>
            <p>His next hearing is scheduled for August.</p>
            <p>Mr Pistorius, 26, is a double amputee who won gold at the London
2012 Paralympic Games and also competed at the Olympics.</p>
            <p>On Friday, his family released video of him training at the High
Performance Centre in the capital, Pretoria.</p>
            <p>In the video, Mr Pistorius can be seen putting on his prostheses
before lightly sprinting on a track.</p>
            <p>The statement on his website said that his focus "remains
entirely on the court case".</p>
            <p>"Oscar is not contemplating a formal return to athletics and his
training is not aimed at preparing for competition," the statement
read.</p>

mistaking her for an intruder</span>
            </div>
            <p>"His family, and those close to him, have encouraged him to
spend a few hours a week on the track to assist him in finding the
necessary mental and emotional equilibrium to process his trauma
and prepare for the trial."</p>
            <p>Mr Pistorius's arrest in February stunned many South Africans
who saw him as a national sporting hero after his long legal battle
to compete in the Olympics.</p>
            <p>The athlete shot his 29-year-old girlfriend through the bathroom
door of his house in Pretoria on 14 February.</p>
            <p>The prosecution has accused him of premeditated murder, alleging
that he killed Ms Steenkamp intentionally after a fight.</p>
            <p>Mr Pistorius was freed on a bail of 1 million rand
(Ã‚Â£74,000; $110,000). A court in March eased
his travel restrictions, allowing him to leave South Africa to
compete as long as he complied with certain conditions.</p>
