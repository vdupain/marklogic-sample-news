            <p class="introduction">Footage shot with
high-speed cameras has revealed how hummingbird wings bend and
flex, to keep the birds in the air.</p>
            <p>Masateru Maeda, a PhD student at Chiba University in Japan,
captured the footage.</p>
            <p>The ultimate aim of his measurements of the movements of the
wings is to copy their function in the design of flying robots.</p>
            <p>The scientist presented his findings at <a href="http://www.sebiology.org/meetings/Valencia/Valencia.html">the
Society for Experimental Biology's annual meeting</a> in Valencia,
Spain.</p>
            <p>The researchers captured their footage at Tama Zoological park
in Tokyo.</p>
            <p>The team chose hummingbirds as their
"wing model" because they can be studied so easily; they hover
quite still as they feed on nectar.</p>
            <p>"And they're very small," added Mr Maeda. "Larger birds that
cannot hover have to be studied in wind tunnels."</p>
            <p>But to get his footage, Mr Maeda had to work in the glasshouse
of the zoo, which is kept at 35C for the birds and butterflies that
live there.</p>
            <p>He trained his high-speed camera on a nectar feeder in order to
capture shots of hummingbirds as they hovered.</p>
            <p>"We are curious about the precise wing shape," Mr Maeda told BBC
News. "The feathers [move and] change the wing area as they are
flapping."</p>
            <p>This movement of the primary flight feathers, the researchers
found, changes the shape and size of the wing in such a way as to
very precisely control the lift they generate.</p>
            <p>The eventual aim is to design wings for miniature flying robots
that would be able to perform in a similar way.</p>
            <p>Mr Maeda and his colleagues have already started a collaboration
with engineers at Chiba University to design a flexible,
bird-inspired wing.</p>
            <p>The team also hopes to learn more about the hummingbirds'
impressive hovering capabilities.</p>
            <p>Mr Maeda said that the birds must have a very acute sense of
their wings' shape in order to remain so still in the air.</p>
            <p>"If the wing shape isn't optimised," he explained, "it will fail
to produce lift and the bird will start to sink.</p>
            <p>"So it must be able to sense this and correct the shape of its
wings."</p>

            <p>As birds and insects move through the air, their wings are held
at a slight angle, which
deÃ¯Â¬Â‚ects the air downward.</p>
            <p>This deflection means the air flows faster over the wing than
underneath, causing air pressure to build up beneath the wings,
while the pressure above the wings is reduced. It is this
diÃ¯Â¬Â€erence in pressure that
produces lift.</p>
            <p>Flapping creates an additional forward and upward force known as
thrust, which counteracts the insect's weight and the "drag" of air
resistance.</p>
            <p>The downstroke or the flap is also called the "power stroke", as
it provides the majority of the thrust. During this, the wing is
angled downwards even more steeply.</p>
            <p>You can imagine this stroke as a very brief downward dive
through the air - it momentarily uses the weight of the animal's
own weight in order to move forwards. But because the wings
continue to generate lift, the creature remains airborne.</p>
            <p>In each upstroke, the wing is slightly folded inwards to reduce
resistance.</p>
