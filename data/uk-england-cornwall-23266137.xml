            <p class="introduction">Work created by
famous sculptor Barbara Hepworth more than 50 years ago has sold at
auction for Ã‚Â£2.4m.</p>
            <p>The sale has beaten the previous record for work sold at auction
by the artist which was almost Ã‚Â£1.4m.</p>
            <p>The work entitled Curved Form (Bryher II) set a new world record
price for a work by the artist, said auction house Christie's.</p>
            <p>The piece is part of the Single Form series, which Barbara
Hepworth worked on throughout her career.</p>
            <p>The work which was signed, dated and numbered 'Barbara Hepworth
1961 1/7' was created at her studio in St Ives, Cornwall.</p>
            <p>It had been estimated to sell for between
Ã‚Â£1m- Ã‚Â£1.5m.</p>
            <p>The sculpture had come from the collection of the late Leopold
de Rothschild who acquired it in 1965 from Gimpel Fils, London.</p>
            <p>The second secretary general of the United Nations, Dag
HammarskjÃƒÂ¶ld, who died in 1961 had been a
great admirer of the sculptor's work.</p>
            <p>He had wanted her produce work for the new United Nations
building in New York.</p>
            <p>In 1961, when the United Nations commissioned Hepworth to make a
sculpture in his memory, she began with Curved Form (Bryher
II).</p>
            <p>In 1964 she delivered her largest ever sculpture, Single Form,
to the United Nations.</p>
            <p>Barbara Hepworth moved to St Ives with her husband Ben Nicholson
in 1939.</p>
            <p>She became a leading light in the town's famous artistic
community during its post-war period of international
prominence.</p>
            <p>Following her death in 1975, her studio was transformed into the
Barbara Hepworth Museum.</p>
