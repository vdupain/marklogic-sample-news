               <span style="width:304px;">Traders have been cheered by news that
the Fed will continue to boost the US economy</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">US shares closed at
record levels after the US central bank indicated that its efforts
to boost the economy would continue for now.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.1% higher at 15,460.92
and the broader S&amp;P 500 added 1.3% to end at a new peak of
1,675.02.</p>
            <p>Both measures surpassed previous record highs hit in late
May.</p>
            <p>Investors have been focusing on when the US Federal Reserve
(Fed) might end its massive bond-buying programme.</p>
            <p>Fed chairman Ben Bernanke had made previous comments suggesting
the policy would be phased out.</p>
            <p>But on Wednesday Mr Bernanke clarified his position, saying a
"highly accommodative" policy was needed for the foreseeable
future.</p>
            <p>Since late last year, each month the Fed has been buying $85bn
(Ã‚Â£56bn) in Treasury and mortgage bonds.</p>
            <p>The purchases have kept interest rates low, with the aim of
encouraging more Americans to buy homes and cars, and hopefully
bolster economic growth.</p>
            <p>Investors worry that once the Fed starts scaling back its bond
buying, interest rates will rise.</p>
            <p>"The Fed has made it unequivocally clear that they are not in
any hurry to do anything," said Alec Young, Global Equity
Strategist at S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p>
            <p>"It's very bullish for stocks," he added.</p>
            <p>The S&amp;P 500 index has risen for six trading sessions in a
row, the longest winning run in four months.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq composite rose 1.4% on Thursday to close at 3,578.30,
its highest level in almost 13 years.</p>
            <p>Microsoft was one of the biggest winners on the stock market on
Thursday.</p>
            <p>Its shares jumped 2.8% after the company announced a plan to
overhaul its structure.</p>
