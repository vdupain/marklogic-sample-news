            <p class="introduction">The National Botanic
Garden of Belgium is staying open late to give visitors a chance to
see one of the world's largest and smelliest flowers.</p>
            <p>The Titan Arum rarely blooms, though the Brussels specimen is
said to have done so three times since 2008.</p>
            <p>The flower rises 2.44m (8ft) off the ground and is expected to
wane on Wednesday after only three days.</p>
            <p>The Titan Arum is also known as the "corpse flower" because of
the strong stench of rotting meat it gives off.</p>
            <p>When the plant is ready to attract pollinators, the spike heats
up and gives off the smell which, while revolting to humans, is
very alluring to insects. It then develops a fruit which attracts
birds before ending its life.</p>
            <p>It is endangered in its natural habitat of the tropical forests
of Sumatra.</p>
            <p>A spokesman for the Jardin de Meise said it was "exceptional"
that its specimen had flowered so frequently.</p>
