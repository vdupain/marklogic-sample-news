            <p class="introduction">Brazil "lost a great
opportunity" to improve public services when it won the right to
host the 2014 football World Cup, Rio de Janeiro's mayor says.</p>
            <p>Eduardo Paes told the BBC Brazil should have seized the occasion
to invest in healthcare, education and transport.</p>
            <p>He spoke after another day of protests against corruption and
the high cost of preparations for the World Cup.</p>
            <p>In the north-eastern city of Fortaleza, police fired tear gas to
disperse protesters ahead of a football match.</p>
            <p>Nearly 90 people were arrested for rioting outside the stadium
in Fortaleza, ahead of the game between Spain and Italy at the
Confederations Cup.</p>
            <p>Several demonstrators and police officers were injured.</p>
            <p>The wave of protests began nearly a month ago in the city Sao
Paulo after bus fares were increased by 10%.</p>
            <p>The rises in Sao Paulo and many other Brazilian cities were
revoked after two weeks of protests.</p>
            <p>By then, the demonstrations had turned into a nationwide
movement for better education, healthcare and transport.</p>

            <p>"Brazil has lost a great opportunity with the World Cup. Fifa
asked for stadiums and Brazil has only delivered stadiums," Mayor
Paes told BBC Newsnight's Tim Whewell in Rio.</p>
            <p>"We should have used the opportunity to deliver good services
too."</p>
            <p>He said the protests were not about the economy, which has
slowed down in the last two years: "We have almost no unemployment.
The protests are much more connected to the quality of services in
Brazil."</p>
            <p>The Brazilian authorities have to find a way of connecting to
the people, Mr Paes said.</p>
            <p>"People want more transparency, they want more openness and that
is what we are going to do."</p>
            <p>Demonstrators are angry at the high cost of preparations for the
World Cup and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.</p>
            <p>The Confederations Cup is part of the preparations.</p>
            <p>It is organised by the world's football body, Fifa, gathering
the champions of each continent, the hosts and the world
champions.</p>
            <p>On Thursday, Spain won the semi-final match against Italy on
penalties and will now play Brazil in the final on Sunday in Rio de
Janeiro.</p>
            <p>On Thursday, protests were staged in Rio de Janeiro, Porto
Alegre and other cities.</p>
            <p>But the largest demonstration is expected to go ahead in Rio,
where protesters are planning to march towards the Maracana stadium
before the final.</p>
            <p>Fifa says the World Cup will go ahead in Brazil as planned.</p>
            <p>"The first game will happen in Sao Paulo, the final will be in
Rio. There is no plan B," said Fifa general-secretary Jeremy
Valcke.</p>
