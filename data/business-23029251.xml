            <p>What is clear, and potentially more important, is that China's
central bank resisted riding to the rescue with cheap loans.</p>

            <p>That decision is what sent a shiver
through the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</p>
            <p>It has highlighted the bigger story: The newly-ensconced
government of President Xi Jinping is deadly serious about
"rebalancing" China's economy.</p>
            <p>If President Xi pulls off this Herculean task, it will mean an
end to the era of cheap lending, the winding down of the country's
enormous construction boom, and <em>much</em> slower economic
growth.</p>
            <p>It is a tectonic shift, of which the recent market jitters are
an early tremor.</p>
            <p>After the 2008 financial crisis, China faced recession in its
main US and European export markets.</p>
            <p>Beijing responded with <a href="http://english.gov.cn/2010-02/27/content_1543507.htm">a massive
stimulus package</a>, accelerating the already-rapid building of
roads, railway lines, steel plants, blocks of flats, and so on, to
keep the workforce busy and the economy expanding at 9%-10% a
year.</p>
            <p>Much of the construction boom was financed by cheap loans, made
readily available by the state-owned banks on orders from
Beijing.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the big beneficiaries of the cheap money
era:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>property developers who did the building work</li>
               <li>local governments who sold or leased the land (often after
expropriating it from farmers)</li>
               <li>heavy industries that produced the construction materials and
tools</li>
               <li>the large state-owned monopolists, many of whom borrowed and
speculated in property and other bubbly areas</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the authorities press ahead with rebalancing, then anyone
making a living in these sectors can expect much leaner times
ahead.</p>
            <p>Delay no longer appears an option. The lending-cum-building boom
<a href="http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/04/15/chinas-growth-ever-diminishing-returns/#axzz2XDDJj8pm">
is running out of steam</a>. Total indebtedness in the economy
<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21579445-chinas-credit-boom-has-got-people-worried-should-they-be-taking-credit">

               <p class="caption">Giant state-owned firms still dominate the
economy but many are inefficient</p>
            </div>
            <p>China may already have <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50142079n">too many roads,
office blocks and so on</a>. And too much of the economy is geared
towards making even more of those things - too many <a href="http://www.scrapregister.com/news/815/china-to-takes-5-to-10-years-to-fix-steel-overcapacity-xu-kuangdi">

even tyre-makers</a>.</p>
            <p>What's more, in the mad rush, a lot of the money may have been
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19049254">completely
wasted on white elephants</a> or <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-22089011">disappeared
into black holes</a>.</p>
            <p>Yet the market jitters highlight just how delicate the
government's task will be.</p>
            <p>If they take a hard line, forcing banks to raise interest rates
and cut back their lending, then many of the loans extended during
the boom <a href="http://english.caixin.com/2012-11-12/100459281.html">may prove
unrepayable</a>.</p>
            <p>The government does not want to trigger a collapse in confidence
and a cascade of loan defaults and bankruptcies, not to mention the
lay-off of millions of construction and industrial workers.</p>
            <p>But allowing the banks and their borrowers more time may simply
be delaying the inevitable.</p>
            <p>The government is particularly concerned about "wealth
management products" (WMPs) - high-yielding investments sold to
citizens with spare cash.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2013/06/24/1544422/about-those-mid-tier-weapons-of-mass-ponzi-in-china/">
WMPs have been increasingly churned out by the banks</a> -
particularly the smaller banks.</p>
            <p>The authorities fear that they are being used as a sneaky way to
raise extra money to pour into the property market and other
speculative activities.</p>
            <p>However, WMPs also play a vital role in financing small
privately-owned businesses, including China's dynamic small-scale
exporters.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21578668-growth-wealth-management-products-reflects-deeper-financial-distortions">
These small borrowers find themselves marginalised</a> from the
mainstream financial system.</p>
            <p>The state-owned banks have prioritised funnelling cheap loans to
the state-owned companies and investment projects targeted by the
government's stimulus plans.</p>
            <p>They are often accused of being more concerned about a
borrower's political standing than its cashflow or
profitability.</p>
            <p>The risk is that if the squeeze on WMPs and other types of
shadowy, but more profit-oriented, lending persists, small
businesses may find themselves cut off from credit altogether -
although thus far <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/06/26/china-savers-flock-to-shadow-bank-deposits-in-response-to-higher-rates/#axzz2XVaQjCKx">
rising interest rates have had the exact opposite effect</a>.</p>
            <p>A lot of very wealthy Chinese also have much to lose from the
end of cheap money.</p>
            <p>Many of the officials who have been directing the flow of
borrowed money, as well as private businessmen enjoying good
government connections ("guanxi"), <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2013/03/23/two-ways-to-become-rich-in-china/">
have done very well for themselves</a> these past five years.</p>

               <p class="caption">President Xi has cracked down on the banqueting
penchant of bureaucrats</p>
            </div>
            <p>If the boom is over, then much of the country's elite will have
to accept a commensurate reduction in their living standards.</p>
            <p>Indeed, this has been made explicit by Beijing, who is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/world/asia/xi-jinping-imposes-austerity-measures-on-chinas-elite.html?pagewanted=all">
clamping down on conspicuous spending by apparatchiks</a>.</p>
            <p>But the problems go deeper than this. <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/27/c_132492877.htm">
If loans have been squandered</a>, then as money becomes tighter,
the squanderers face the risk of exposure, <a href="http://nationalforex.com/2013/05/20/lin-haiyan-sentenced-to-death-for-running-a-640-million-yuan-100-million-ponzi-scheme-in-china/">
with serious personal consequences</a>.</p>
            <p>The allocation of pain within the elite could become very
political, with some factions taking the fall for the years of
profligacy. <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/03/29/the_revenge_of_wen_jiabao">
Bo Xilai springs to mind</a>.</p>
            <p>A common assumption in China is that, because the banks are
state-owned and information tightly controlled by the state, a
Lehman-style financial crisis is unlikely.</p>
            <p>This may not be entirely correct.</p>
            <p>China's censorship, and the resulting public uncertainty, could
actually make its citizens more prone to sudden, overwhelming
panic, <a href="http://www.estudosavancados.iea.usp.br/english/archives/oldsiteinenglish/articlesbooks/pettissars.pdf">
as exemplified by the 2003 Sars crisis</a>.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Prof Michael Pettis of Beijing
University argues that the 2003 Sars panic resembled a financial
panic</span>
            </div>
            <p>And many wealthy and middle-class Chinese do stand to lose out
on their investments if things go wrong.</p>
            <p>They have bought those high-yielding WMPs. But - much like the
repackaged mortgage debts that caused havoc in 2008 - if the murky
loans underlying these products go bad, the losses are passed
straight through to the end investor.</p>
            <p>They have also invested in property (and wealthier Chinese, in
multiple properties that often sit empty).</p>
            <p>But the end of cheap money could <a href="http://soberlook.com/2013/06/new-threats-to-chinas-property-bubble.html?utm_source=feedly">
kick the legs out from under the frothy housing market</a> - for
instance if struggling developers, businessmen and local
governments are forced to sell.</p>
            <p>All this raises a big risk for the whole country.</p>
            <p>If China's super-wealthy, particularly those concerned about
their political future, see the writing on the wall, then they may
try to cash in their assets and move their money to the safest
place they can - outside China.</p>
            <p>And if panic spreads to the middle classes, they may decide a
low-interest account at a state-owned bank is a much safer bet than
owning property or those tantalising WMPs.</p>
            <p>Yet any such rush for the doors would simply accelerate the day
of reckoning.</p>
