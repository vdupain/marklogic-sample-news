            <p class="introduction">A former Chinese
official accused of accepting bribes in an alleged sex tape
extortion scandal has been put on trial, state media say.</p>
            <p>Lei Zhengfu's trial opened on Wednesday at the Chongqing No. 1
Intermediate People's Court in southwest China.</p>
            <p>The senior Chongqing official was removed from his post and held
by police after a sex tape featuring him emerged online last
year.</p>
            <p>At least 10 officials have been dismissed as a result of the
scandal.</p>
            <p>Mr Lei is accused of accepting bribes of around 3.16m Chinese
yuan ($0.51m; Ã‚Â£0.33m), Chinese media
said.</p>
            <p>The businessman who arranged the alleged trap and the woman in
the video with Mr Lei are also due to face court.</p>
            <p>The businessman, Xiao Ye, is accused of luring several officials
into so-called "honey traps".</p>
            <p>His idea was to use the videos to extort money or ensure
favourable contracts for property developments, reports say.</p>
            <p>The blackmail scheme was exposed by a blogger and investigative
journalist Zhu Ruifeng.</p>
