               <span style="width:304px;">Portugal has seen protests against the government
over austerity reform plans</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Portugal's borrowing
costs have risen sharply amid fears of a growing political crisis
in the country.</p>
            <p>Yields on the country's benchmark 10-year bonds moved above 8%
at one point, while the stock market closed down 5.3%.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, the resignations of two leading ministers put
pressure on Portugal's coalition government.</p>
            <p>The European Commission President, Jose Manuel Barroso, said he
was following the situation "with concern".</p>
            <p>Portugal received a bailout worth more than 78bn euros ($102bn;
Ã‚Â£67bn) in May 2011, on the condition it
implemented austerity measures.</p>
            <p>Demonstrators have taken to the streets in recent days to
protest against planned austerity reforms.</p>
            <p>On Monday, Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar resigned, followed by
Foreign Minister Paulo Portas, who heads the Popular Party - the
junior partner in the coalition government.</p>
            <p>The resignations came amid disagreements over Portugal's
austerity path.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho has
pledged to stay in office, but it is not clear whether the Popular
Party will continue to work with him.</p>
            <p>Local media reports say that two more ministers are expected to
resign.</p>
            <p>The President, Anibal Cavaco Silva, said he would be meeting
members of all parties, including the prime minister, in the coming
days in an effort to resolve the growing crisis.</p>
            <p>Portugal has been in recession for two years and the economy is
expected to contract by 2.3% this year.</p>
            <p>The sharp rise in bond yields suggests investors are less
confident that Portugal will be able to repay its international
debts.</p>
            <p>"The political uncertainty in Portugal has really spooked
markets," said Ishaq Siddiqi, a financial market strategist at
ETXCapital.</p>

message of no confidence (in Portugal) from the market"</p>
            </div>
            <p>"The spectre of another bailout for the country increases on
fears of a collapse of the government [that] will result in the
country not being able to meet its loan obligations with its
international creditors."</p>
            <p>Yields on Spanish and Italian bonds have also risen, while the
stock markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt closed more than 1%
lower.</p>
            <p>Mr Barroso said: "The initial reaction of the markets shows the
obvious risk that the financial credibility recently built up by
Portugal could be jeopardised by the current political
instability.</p>
            <p>"If this happens it would be especially damaging for the
Portuguese people, particularly as there were already preliminary
signs of economic recovery.</p>
            <p>"This delicate situation requires a great sense of
responsibility from all political forces and leaders."</p>
