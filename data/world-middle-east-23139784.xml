shooting her son</p>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The murder of a boy
accused of blasphemy has come to symbolise concerns about the power
of Islamist radicals in Syria's armed uprising. Paul Wood reports
from Aleppo on how Sharia is spreading in rebel-held areas.</p>
            <p>Mohammed Qataa's mother wanders the streets of Aleppo looking
into strangers' faces as she tries to find her son's killers.</p>
            <p>She knows she would recognise them. She was looking right at
them when, in front of a dumbstruck and terrified crowd, Mohammed
was shot dead, accused of blasphemy.</p>
            <p>She remembers Mohammed as a happy, dutiful son, well known and
well-liked in the Shaar neighbourhood where the men of the family
scrape a living with a coffee cart.</p>
            <p>He was 14 years old, but with no schooling possible because of
the war he was usually to be found on the busy main thoroughfare
through Shaar, selling the thick, sweet coffee they prefer
here.</p>
            <p>One day last month, someone asked him for a free cup. "Not even
if the Prophet himself returns," he had replied, laughing. That
remark was a death sentence.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Mohammed Qataa, 14, was condemned for a
joke he made when asked for a free cup of coffee</span>
            </div>
            <p>It was overheard by three armed men. They dragged him to a car
and took him away. Half-an-hour later, a badly beaten Mohammed was
dumped back in the road by his cart.</p>
            <p>The men, showing no fear that anyone would question what they
were doing, summoned a crowd with shouts of "Oh People of Aleppo.
Oh people of Shaar." Their bellows alerted Mohammed's mother.</p>
            <p>Recalling what happened next, she buries her face in her hands
and weeps.</p>
            <p>"One of them shouted: 'Whoever insults the Prophet will be
killed according to Sharia'," she told me.</p>
            <p>"I ran down barefoot to the streets. I heard the first shot. I
fell to the ground when I got there.</p>
            <p>"One of them shot him again and kicked him. He shot him for a
third time and stamped on him.</p>
            <p>"I said: 'Why are you killing him? He's still a child!' The man
shouted: 'He is not a Muslim - leave!'"</p>
            <p>After the murder on 10 June, pictures of Mohammed's body went
viral on Facebook and Twitter in Arabic.</p>
            <p>He had been shot in the face, a hole where his nose and mouth
should have been.</p>
            <p>There was an outcry. It was claimed that the killers were from
the main group linked to al-Qaeda here, the Islamic State of Iraq
and Syria. Suspicion also fell on the Nusra Front, the biggest
Islamist organisation in the uprising.</p>
            <p>Both issued statements condemning the murder, as did almost all
of Aleppo's rebel brigades, and the city's main Sharia court.</p>
            <p>We met a judge there, a 26-year-old
Islamic scholar barely out of university, with a wispy beard and
round glasses.</p>
            <p>He told me the men were regime militia, "shabiha", trying to
foment trouble between jihadis and other fighters.</p>
            <p>I found that explanation rather convenient, along with the
disavowals of the murder by the two Islamist groups linked to
al-Qaeda.</p>
            <p>Would regime thugs really have risked entering the heart of
opposition-held Aleppo to abduct a boy - and then have returned
half-an-hour later to kill him in the street?</p>
            <p>The family say the evidence is confusing. The men spoke the
classical Arabic of the Koran, yet made simple mistakes. They made
the odd statement that blaspheming against God could be forgiven
but insulting the Prophet was a capital offence.</p>
            <p>The four looked like jihadis but stopped to buy a packet of
sunflower seeds. People explained that the truly pious would not
eat sunflower seeds because they take so long to shell - and the
Prophet said not to waste time.</p>
            <p>But though the family don't know - or are too afraid to say -
which armed group is to blame for Mohammed's death, they maintain
that the rebel authorities bear ultimate responsibility.</p>
            <p>"We have no freedom left," says Mohammed's older brother,
Fouad.</p>
            <p>"We had it when the rebels first took over in Aleppo but now we
have nothing. What we have instead are countless [Sharia]
committees, each following its own interpretation of religion."</p>
            <p>Aleppo's main Sharia court has taken pains to stress that though
Mohammed Qataa's murderers said they were acting in the name of
Islam, the killing was un-Islamic, a criminal act.</p>
            <p>But whatever the killers' real motives - whether a brutal trick
by the regime or a cruel and extreme interpretation of Islam by
jihadis - it is also true that Sharia is spreading in rebel-held
parts of Syria.</p>
            <p>A documentary team from BBC Arabic went to the northern town of
Saraqeb to follow the work of the Sharia court there, gaining
extraordinary access over a period of six weeks.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Four men convicted of trying to steal a
taxi in Saraqeb's Sharia court were sentenced to whipping using an
electric cable</span>
            </div>
            <p>The court is run by a 27-year-old former preacher, Sheikh
Abdullah Mohammed Ali, who hands out sentences dressed in
Afghan-style shalwar kameez, a Kalashnikov at his side.</p>
            <p>Four men convicted of trying to steal a taxi driver's car are
brought before him. Although admitting their guilt, they claim to
be members of a rebel brigade.</p>
            <p>Sheikh Abdullah tells them their weapons will be confiscated and
they will not be allowed to be part of any armed group in
future.</p>
            <p>He swiftly decides that the sentence will be a public flogging.
The men are driven to the centre of Saraqeb for sentence to be
carried out. The instrument of punishment is an electrical
cable.</p>
            <p>Sheikh Abdullah takes a megaphone to address a small crowd that
has gathered.</p>
            <p>"In the name of God," he says, reading out the names of the four
prisoners standing in a row. "Fifty lashes for the leader of the
gang. Forty for each of his men."</p>
            <p>He declares: "God's law is the best protection for the
weak."</p>
            <p>The first of the prisoners is forced to his knees, a man on
either side of him holding his arms. When it starts some of the
crowd chant, "The Prophet is our leader". Others just count the
lashes.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, Sheikh Abdullah explains to the documentary crew
that the punishment was actually quite lenient. They had been
convicted of highway robbery. The normal penalty for that is death,
he says.</p>
            <p>"In wartime, punishments according to Sharia are suspended until
peace returns," he says.</p>
            <p>"Now, we are at war. We must concentrate on fighting the
regime's army. Full punishments will be enforced as soon as the
regime falls and an Islamic State is declared."</p>
            <p>The uprising's rural, conservative and religious supporters
approve of Sharia's harsh penalties.</p>
            <p>So too, perhaps, do many of those afraid of the criminal
anarchy, the looting, killing, kidnapping and theft, that has
become an everyday fact of life in rebel-held areas.</p>

            </div>
            <p>But many in Saraqeb are dismayed by the rise of the Islamists.
There have been small street protests in the town against
Sharia.</p>
            <p>"We did not hope for what we have come to today," said Lyas
Kadouni, an activist interviewed by BBC Arabic.</p>
            <p>"The names of [rebel] brigades tell you how people think now -
names like 'Lovers of the Prophet Brigade' and so on. It is not
necessary to throw religion into every corner of your life. This is
killing our revolution."</p>
            <p>Painfully earnest, Lyas Kadouni wants to tidy up Saraqeb's
streets. "The most important thing is to practise the duties of
citizenship," he says.</p>
            <p>"We have to showÃ¢Â€Â¦ we have an
alternative to chaos."</p>
            <p>He says he is "100% certain they [foreign jihadis] will
disappear". It could take a month, two, or three months, he
says.</p>
            <p>But the influence of relatively secular activists like Lyas
Kadouni, always marginal, is waning still further.</p>
            <p>Almost two years after peaceful protest became a civil war, they
are still painting murals and handing out leaflets. Others,
meanwhile, are taking power at the point of a gun.</p>
            <p>Things are not going entirely the Islamists' way, however. They
have split and split again over the question of whether to unify
with al-Qaeda. There is also a bitter ongoing battle with elements
of the Free Syrian Army.</p>
            <p>While most fighting on the rebel side are Muslim, many of those
do not want a religious state.</p>
            <p>The commander of one such unit told me the Islamist Nusra Front
had sent a suicide bomber to one of his positions, killing a dozen
of his men. Then his brother was kidnapped by the jihadis. After
paying a ransom of tens of thousands of dollar to get his brother
back, he would now seek revenge.</p>
            <p>"There will be nowhere for them to hide."</p>
            <p>Even as government forces sweep into previously opposition-held
towns, the rebels are fighting amongst themselves, hardline jihadis
against the relatively secular FSA, a civil war within the civil
war.</p>
            <p>The battle, though sporadic, seems just as bitter as that
against the regime.</p>
            <p>Its outcome will determine what kind of state Syria will become
if the rebels win. In the meantime, though, Sharia justice is the
only kind available in many parts of Syria.</p>
