               <span style="width:464px;">Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys was seen
boarding a plane in northern Somalia on Saturday with Somali
government soldiers</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A top Somali
Islamist, Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, has been transferred under
armed guard from the airport in the capital Mogadishu following his
arrival there on Saturday.</p>
            <p>He is now being questioned at a government intelligence
base.</p>
            <p>He was moved after a fight broke out between government
officials, members of the security forces and clan elders over what
to do with him.</p>
            <p>He has been designated a terrorist by the UN and the US.</p>
            <p>He was held after fleeing fighting between factions of the
Islamist group, al-Shabab, amid reports of a split in the
group.</p>
            <p>A delegation that accompanied Hassan Dahir Aweys from central
Somalia has accused the government of reneging on a promise to
grant him an amnesty.</p>

               <img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/67456000/gif/_67456379_som_controlled_areas_070513.gif"

            </div>
            <p>The Somali government has made no official comment.</p>
            <p>On Saturday, Sheikh Aweys was flown from the northern town of
Adado, escorted by government security forces, but it was unclear
whether he had surrendered or defected.</p>
            <p>The United Nations says he gave himself up to government allies
after infighting, but clan elders deny this.</p>
            <p>Regarded as the elder statesman of Somali Islamists, he has been
on a US list of people "linked to terrorism" since shortly after
the 9/11 attacks in 2001.</p>
            <p>A new UN-backed government in Mogadishu is trying to regain
control of the country from al-Shabab after more than 20 years of
conflict.</p>
            <p>Supported by some 18,000 African Union soldiers, President
Hassan Sheikh Mohamud's administration is the first in more than
two decades to be recognised by the US and the International
Monetary Fund.</p>
            <p>Al-Shabab, which means "The Youth", is fighting to create an
Islamic state in Somalia - and despite being pushed out of key
cities in the past two years still remains in control of smaller
towns and large swathes of the countryside.</p>
            <p>The exact cause of the al-Shabab split is not known, but there
has been a long-running internal power struggle between its leader
Ahmed Abdi Godane and those seen as more moderate who oppose links
with al-Qaeda, analysts say.</p>
