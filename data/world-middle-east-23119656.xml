about political criticism expressed online</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A court in Saudi
Arabia has sentenced seven cyber activists to between five to 10
years in prison for inciting protests, mainly by using
Facebook.</p>
            <p>The men were arrested in September last year, according to Human
Rights Watch (HRW), and their trial began in April.</p>
            <p>They were charged with posting online messages to encourage
protests, although they were not accused of directly taking part in
demonstrations.</p>
            <p>It is seen as the country's latest move against online political
dissent.</p>
            <p>The New York-based rights group HRW said the case was heard in
an anti-terrorism court.</p>
            <p>The longest sentence of 10 years was reportedly given to an
activist who set up two Facebook groups allegedly explaining the
best protest techniques.</p>
            <p>The rights group said the men had all
admitted contributing to Facebook pages supporting the leading Shia
cleric Tawfiq al-Amer, who was held in February 2011 after calling
for a constitutional monarchy.</p>
            <p>His arrest provoked anti-government rallies inspired by a wave
of popular revolt in the country's Eastern Region, where much of
its crude oil is sourced.</p>
            <p>The seven men were sentenced on 24 June for "allegedly inciting
protests and harming public order, largely by using Facebook", HRW
said.</p>
            <p>The court also barred them from travelling for additional
periods.</p>
            <p>Several of the defendants said they had been tortured into
signing confessions, according to HRW.</p>
            <p>The case contained two elements that the Saudi authorities are
particularly sensitive about, the BBC World Service's Middle East
editor Sebastian Usher reports - political criticism expressed
online and protests staged by the Shia minority in the east of the
country.</p>
            <p>Several Saudi human rights campaigners have recently been
imprisoned. Two women were jailed earlier in June for allegedly
inciting a woman against her husband, after they tried to help a
Canadian who had complained of abuse by her Saudi husband.</p>
            <p>HRW urged European Union officials to condemn the latest
convictions ahead of a meeting with Gulf leaders on Sunday.</p>
            <p>"Sending people off to years in prison for peaceful Facebook
posts sends a strong message that there's no safe way to speak out
in Saudi Arabia, even on online social networks," Joe Stork, HRW's
deputy Middle East director, said.</p>
