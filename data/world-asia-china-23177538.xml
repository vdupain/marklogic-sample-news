            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Chinese and US
officials have discussed hacking concerns at the inaugural meeting
of a joint US-China working group on cyber security.</p>
            <p>The meeting on Monday was a prelude to an annual high-level
forum between the world's two largest economies.</p>
            <p>The US has previously accused China of commercial cyber
espionage - something China denies.</p>
            <p>The US-China talks have also been overshadowed by allegations
that the US has hacked into Chinese networks.</p>
            <p>The claims were made by fugitive US whistleblower Edward
Snowden.</p>
            <p>The former government contractor told a Hong Kong newspaper last
month that America's National Security Agency had led more than
61,000 hacking operations worldwide, with many targets in Hong Kong
and mainland China.</p>
            <p>The two sides set up the cyber security working group in April,
to speed up action to prevent hacking attacks.</p>
            <p>The working group was led by US cyber issues co-ordinator
Christopher Painter and Chinese Foreign Ministry official Dai
Bing.</p>
            <p>The US hoped that Monday's talks would "enable the two sides to
share perspectives on international laws and norms in cyberspace",
US state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.</p>
            <p>The working group talks come ahead of the US-China Strategic and
Economic Dialogue, a key annual ministerial meeting between the two
countries. That forum is set to take place on Wednesday and
Thursday.</p>
            <p>US Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob
Lew will host the meeting in Washington, attended by China's State
Councillor Yang Jiechi and Vice Premier Wang Yang.</p>
            <p>The US has said that many hacking attacks on its networks - both
government and commercial - originated in China.</p>
            <p>In February one US security firm issued a report accusing a
secretive Chinese military unit of being behind many of the
attacks.</p>
            <p>The Chinese government has repeatedly denied responsibility,
saying it is a victim of US-based attacks.</p>
