            <p class="introduction">The main provision
of a landmark healthcare bill passed under President Barack Obama
will take effect one year later than planned, his administration
has said.</p>
            <p>Employers now have until 2015 to extend healthcare benefits to
their employees.</p>
            <p>The move has been seen as a major concession to retailers and
other businesses.</p>
            <p>But it puts off the law's aim of giving coverage to nearly 50
million Americans without health insurance.</p>
            <p>It also raises questions over whether other elements of the bill
will be implemented on schedule, analysts say.</p>
            <p>"We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements
and the need for more time to implement them effectively," said
Treasury Assistant Secretary Mark Mazur in a blog post.</p>
            <p>"We have listened to your feedback and we are taking
action."</p>
            <p>Business groups hailed the unexpected decision, saying it would
give employers more time to prepare for the changes without having
to incur penalties. But it could mean that many Americans remain
uninsured.</p>
            <p>The 2010 Affordable Care Act, sometimes known as Obamacare,
requires businesses with more than 50 workers to provide health
insurance to all their full-time staff, or pay a series of
increasingly severe penalties.</p>
            <p>From 1 January 2014 companies would have had to pay $2,000
(Ã‚Â£1,320) for each uninsured employee, but
the measure will now not be introduced until 2015.</p>
            <p>There is no fine for smaller businesses or for companies with
workers who qualify for Medicaid, a government healthcare programme
for the poor.</p>
            <p>It was expected to have the greatest impact on hotel, restaurant
and retail businesses that have many low-paid workers.</p>
            <p>"We commend the administration's wise move," said National
Retail Federation vice-president Neil Trautwein.</p>
            <p>Correspondents say that while the change could upset some
liberal and labour groups, it may also help Democrats in
congressional elections in 2014.</p>
            <p>Some Republicans said the decision was proof that the whole law
should be repealed.</p>
            <p>"The White House seems to slowly be admitting what Americans
already know," said Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the
Senate. "Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced with
common-sense reforms that actually lower costs for Americans."</p>
            <p>But White House adviser Valerie Jarrett wrote: "In our ongoing
discussions with businesses we have heard that you need the time to
get this right. We are listening."</p>
            <p>Tuesday's delay to the introduction of the so-called employers'
mandate does not affect another part of the healthcare law that
requires all individuals to have their own insurance or pay a
fine.</p>
            <p>That provision had faced a legal challenge that eventually came
before the Supreme Court last year. The justices ruled that the
so-called individual mandate was constitutional.</p>
