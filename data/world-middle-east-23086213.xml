            <p class="introduction">A blast in an old
Christian quarter of the Syrian capital Damascus has left four
people dead, in what Syrian state TV describes as a suicide
attack.</p>
            <p>Several people were injured in the attack in the Bab Sharqi
neighbourhood, near a church.</p>
            <p>Rebel sources confirmed the number of dead, but said the attack
was caused by a mortar bomb.</p>
            <p>More than 90,000 people have died and millions have been
displaced by Syria's two-year conflict, the UN says.</p>
            <p>Reports say that the bomber was wearing a suicide belt and blew
himself up outside the Virgin Mary Greek Orthodox church.</p>
            <p>Some shops were damaged in the blast.</p>
            <p>No-one has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
            <p>There have been consistent but unverified reports of violence
directed against Christians in Syria since the uprising began in
March 2011, including attacks on churches.</p>
            <p>Syria's Christians are believed to make up about 10% of the
population, but despite their minority status they have long been
among Syria's elite.</p>
            <p>They were at first reluctant to take sides in the rebellion
against President Bashar al-Assad but have gradually been drawn
into the conflict on both sides.</p>
