            <p class="introduction">Police in Peru have
fired tear gas at students and civil servants protesting in the
streets of the capital, Lima, against new public sector
legislation.</p>
            <p>Riot police clashed with demonstrators who attempted to approach
the presidential palace.</p>
            <p>President Ollanta Humala has signed into law a bill introducing
annual performance assessments for civil servants and university
lecturers.</p>
            <p>Critics say the reforms will cost jobs and compromise university
autonomy.</p>
            <p>President Humala says the new rules will improve standards at
universities and in the civil service.</p>
            <p>The legislation was approved on Tuesday in Congress by 59 votes
to 45, with three abstentions, after months of debate.</p>
            <p>Further legislation on the Peruvian civil service is still to be
voted by the Congress.</p>
            <p>Mr Humala was elected in 2011 with a left-wing agenda, but
protesters say he has betrayed the electorate.</p>
            <p>"This government has refused to negotiate with us. It has talked
to politicians, businessmen, but it has treated the workers as
second class citizens," said the Peruvian Workers Confederation
(CTP) in a statement.</p>
            <p>Protests were held in several other Peruvian cities.</p>
