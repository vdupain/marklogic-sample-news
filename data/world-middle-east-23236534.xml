            <p class="introduction">Egypt's interim
leader has outlined his timetable for new elections, amid
continuing unrest in the country.</p>
            <p>Adly Mansour's decree envisages changes to the Islamist-drafted
constitution and a referendum, which would pave way the way for
elections early next year.</p>
            <p>This comes as at least 51 people were killed in the capital
Cairo.</p>
            <p>The Muslim Brotherhood says its members were fired on at a
sit-in for ousted President Mohammad Morsi. The army says it
responded to an armed provocation.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi, an Islamist and Egypt's first
freely elected leader, was removed from office by the army last
week after mass protests.</p>
            <p>His supporters accuse the military of staging a coup, but his
opponents say the move is the continuation of the revolution that
deposed President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.</p>
            <p>Mr Mansour issued the decree late on Monday.</p>
            <p>It says that a panel to amend the constitution - which was
suspended last week - would be formed within 15 days.</p>
            <p>The changes would then be put to a referendum - to be organised
within four months.</p>
            <p>This would lead to parliamentary elections - which could be held
early in 2014.</p>
            <p>Finally, presidential elections would be called once the new
parliament convenes.</p>
            <p>The Muslim Brotherhood has so far made no public comment on the
proposed timetable.</p>
            <p>Mr Mansour's move comes amid continuing mass protests by both
supporters and opponents of Mohammad Morsi.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The situation will have to improve radically if Mr Mansour's
timetable for elections is not to prove hopelessly unrealistic, the
BBC's Jim Muir in Cairo reports.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, the focus will remain on trying to prevent
another explosion of violence and to agree on an interim prime
minister to form a transitional government to stabilise the country
and prepare for elections.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the United States has condemned the violence in
Egypt, calling for "maximum restraint".</p>
            <p>A White House statement said Washington was "not aligned" with
any political movement, adding that cutting military aid to Egypt
was not in US interests.</p>
            <p>There were conflicting reports over what happened outside the
Presidential Guard barracks in Cairo on Monday morning.</p>
            <p>The Muslim Brotherhood put the number of dead at 53, and said
children were among the victims.</p>
            <p>It said the army raided its sit-in at about 04:00 (02:00 GMT) as
protesters were praying.</p>
            <p>Later, in an emotional news briefing, members of the Muslim
Brotherhood accused military chief Gen Abdul Fattah al-Sisi of
being "an assassin and a butcher".</p>
            <p>The health ministry said at least 51 people were killed and 435
people wounded.</p>
            <p>Speaking to journalists, army spokesman Col Ahmed Mohammed Ali
said a group armed with live ammunition, petrol bombs and stones
had attacked security forces.</p>
            <p>He said that two police and one soldier were killed in the
exchange of fire. Eight soldiers were critically wounded.</p>
            <p>The spokesman added that one soldier had been shot through the
top of the head from above, indicating that snipers were firing
from high buildings.</p>
            <p>Col Ali also disputed claims that children had died, saying
pictures of dead children posted on the internet were in fact
images taken in Syria in March.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi is believed by the Muslim Brotherhood to be held at the
barracks, but the military says he is elsewhere.</p>
