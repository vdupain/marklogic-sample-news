               <span style="width:304px;">Elizabeth Mort ate an everything bagel - with poppy
seeds - the afternoon before she gave birth</span>

            <p class="introduction">A US woman whose newborn was taken from her
because she failed a hospital drug test after eating a poppy seed
bagel has won a settlement, says her lawyer.</p>
            <p>A child welfare agency and hospital in Pennsylvania have paid
Elizabeth Mort $143,500 (Ã‚Â£94,500) for the
mistake.</p>
            <p>Her three-day old daughter, Isabella, was removed from her for
five days in April 2010.</p>
            <p>The lawsuit argued that the opiate test in question had a far
lower threshold than federal guidelines.</p>
            <p>Jameson Hospital failed to inform Ms Mort that she had failed
the test, then reported it to Lawrence County children and youth
services without a secondary test.</p>
            <p>"Elizabeth Mort never imagined that the last thing she ate
before giving birth to her daughter - a poppy seed bagel - would
lead to the loss of her newborn, but that is exactly what happened
after the Jameson Health System failed to account for the
possibility that her positive urine drug screen was due to her
ingestion of poppy seeds," <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/Mortcmplnt.pdf">the lawsuit
said</a>.</p>
            <p>Child welfare officials arrived the day after the family
returned from hospital with an emergency protective custody order
and took Isabella.</p>
            <p>She was later returned after the agency could find no evidence
Ms Mort had used illegal drugs.</p>
            <p>The lawsuit, which was filed on her behalf by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU), was settled on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>ACLU officials said Jameson had changed its policy to ensure
newborns were not taken from parents solely on the basis of
maternal drug test results.</p>
            <p>"We hope that this case will encourage hospitals that routinely
test pregnant women for drug use to reconsider that practice due to
the harm that can result from false positives," said ACLU lawyer
Sara Rose.</p>
