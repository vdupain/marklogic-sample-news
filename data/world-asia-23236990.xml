            </div>
            <p class="introduction">North and South
Korea have started in-depth talks on reopening a jointly-run
industrial zone in Kaesong.</p>
            <p>The two sides agreed in principle to restart operations at the
Kaesong Industrial Complex after marathon negotiations over the
weekend.</p>
            <p>South Korea says it wants assurances that Pyongyang will not
unilaterally close the factory zone again.</p>
            <p>Work at the Kaesong zone has been suspended since mid-April,
when North Korea withdrew its workers.</p>
            <p>The move came amid high tensions after Pyongyang's 12 February
nuclear test.</p>
            <p>The Kaesong complex, which is located just inside North Korea,
is home to more than 120 South Korean factories which employ some
53,000 North Korean workers.</p>
            <p>The joint project is both a symbol of inter-Korean co-operation
and a key source of revenue for Pyongyang.</p>
            <p>Sun Ho, who led the South Korean delegation, said his team would
strive to accomplish "developmental normalisation" of the complex
"in accordance with common sense and international rules".</p>
            <p>Another official at the Unification Ministry said: "The weekend
marked the first step, but the difficult part starts now."</p>
            <p>On Tuesday, a small team of South Koreans
crossed into North Korea to check communication and power lines. It
was the first time South Koreans had entered the zone in two
months.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday, around 100 delegates, including dozens of
government officials and businessmen and engineers, entered North
Korea to begin formal talks.</p>
            <p>Pyongyang has agreed to allow the businessmen to inspect their
factories and retrieve finished goods.</p>
            <p>The visit is the first positive sign of thawing relations
between the two Koreas in more than three months, but there are
still big differences to bridge, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul
reports.</p>
            <p>Both sides blame the other for the suspension of operations at
Kaesong, and South Korea is now demanding safeguards as a condition
for reopening the zone, our correspondent adds.</p>
            <p>"The South wants the North to announce
solid actions that will convince everyone that it has no intention
of taking unilateral action to prevent movement or pull out its
labourers in the future," Sun Ho said.</p>
            <p>"Pyongyang must take responsibility for its actions that caused
considerable damage to South Korean companies with factories at the
border town," he added.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, North Korea's chief delegate, Park Chol-su, said he
hoped both sides would "promptly proceed" with restarting the
zone.</p>
            <p>"It is raining heavily, so I am very worried about those
companies' facilities and raw materials," he said.</p>
            <p>Pyongyang is reportedly expected to request that operations
resume at once and that its workers receive higher pay.</p>
            <p>Last week, some South Korean firms threatened to abandon the
zone entirely and relocate their equipment.</p>
            <p>A spokesman representing electronic and machinery makers in
Kaesong had said: "Kaesong must be reopened or [the factories] have
to move elsewhere".</p>
