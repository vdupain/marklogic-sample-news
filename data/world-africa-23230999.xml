            </div>
            <p class="introduction">US-based Nigerian
writer Tope Folarin has won this year's prestigious Caine Prize for
African Writing.</p>
            <p>He received the Ã‚Â£10,000 ($15,000) prize
for his short story Miracle, set in an evangelical Nigerian church
in the US city of Texas.</p>
            <p>The judges described it as a "delightful and beautifully paced
narrative".</p>
            <p>Mr Folarin was among five writers short-listed for the prize,
regarded as Africa's leading literary award.</p>
            <p>Three other Nigerians were short-listed - Elnathan John for
Bayan Layi, Abubakar Adam Ibrahim for The Whispering Trees and
Chinelo Okparanta for America.</p>
            <p>Sierra Leone's Pede Hollist was the only non-Nigerian
short-listed for his short story Foreign Aid.</p>
            <p>Ms Okparanta was the only female contender.</p>
            <p>The chair of judges, Gus Casely-Hayford, awarded Mr Folarin the
prize at a dinner held at the Bodleian Library at Oxford University
in the UK.</p>
            <p>"Tope Folarin's Miracle is another superb Caine Prize winner - a
delightful and beautifully paced narrative, that is exquisitely
observed and utterly compelling," he said.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://www.caineprize.com/pdf/2013_Folarin.pdf">In
Miracle</a>, a congregation gathers at a church to witness the
healing powers of a blind pastor-prophet.</p>
            <p>"Religion and the gullibility of those caught in the deceit that
sometimes comes with faith rise to the surface as a young boy
volunteers to be healed and begins to believe in miracles," the
Caine Prize said in a statement.</p>
            <p>This is the second consecutive year that a Nigerian has won the
prize.</p>
            <p>Last year's winner was Rotimi Babatunde for his story Bombay's
Republic - about Nigerian soldiers who fought in the Burma campaign
during World War II.</p>
