            <p class="introduction">Novelist Jeanette
Winterson is to write a "cover version" of Shakespeare's The
Winter's Tale as part of a major project to reimagine the Bard's
works for modern readers.</p>
            <p>The project - known as The Hogarth Shakespeare - will launch in
2016 to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death.</p>
            <p>Winterson, author of Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, and
Pulitzer Prize-winner Anne Tyler are the first authors to be
commissioned.</p>
            <p>"All of us have talismanic texts that we have carried around and
that carry us around," Winterson said.</p>
            <p>"I have worked with The Winter's Tale in
many disguises for many years. This is a brilliant opportunity to
work with it in its own right. And I love cover versions."</p>
            <p>Last year saw the publication of Winterson's The Daylight Gate,
a novella retelling the 17th-Century Pendle Witches case as part of
the new Hammer Horror fiction series.</p>
            <p>Tyler, who has selected Shakespeare's comedy The Taming of the
Shrew, said: "I don't know which I'm looking forward to more:
delving into the mysteries of shrewish Kate or finding out what all
the other writers do with their Shakespeare characters."</p>
            <p>According to Hogarth, Random House's transatlantic fiction
imprint, the new versions of Shakespeare "will be true to the
spirit of the original dramas and their popular appeal, while
giving authors an exciting opportunity to reinvent these seminal
works of English literature".</p>
            <p>The novels will be published simultaneously across the
English-speaking world in print, digital and audio formats.</p>
            <p>Discussions with other authors are taking place with further
announcements "expected soon".</p>
            <p>Winterson and Tyler's forthcoming works are the latest in a long
line of Shakespearean reinterpretations.</p>
            <p>Among the best-known examples are the musical West Side Story,
inspired by Romeo and Juliet, and 1950s science-fiction film
Forbidden Planet, which shares many elements of The Tempest.</p>
            <p>"The opportunity to ask our best living writers to reinterpret
Shakespeare's many worlds has proved irresistible" said Clara
Farmer, publishing director of Hogarth and Chatto &amp; Windus.</p>
            <p>"The time is ripe for a dedicated series of stand-alone
retellings that will form a covetable library and a celebration of
Shakespeare for years to come."</p>
