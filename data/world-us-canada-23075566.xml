            <p class="introduction">Anti-drug agents in
the United States say 225 people have been arrested in a major
international operation against synthetic drugs.</p>
            <p>Some 1,100 lb (500kg) of drugs have been seized in the US, Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) officials said.</p>
            <p>Arrests have been made in the US, Australia, Canada, Barbados
and Panama.</p>
            <p>The drugs are sold largely to "teenagers and young adults" under
names such as K2 and Vanilla Sky, said DEA chief of operations
James Capra.</p>
            <p>"The bottom line is that these drugs are being marketed to the
most vulnerable part of our society," said Mr Capra.</p>
            <p>Designer drugs are produced in clandestine laboratories and sold
in colourful packaging, which the authorities say are aimed at
appealing to younger consumers.</p>
            <p>The operation was "a terrific result for law enforcement
agencies across the globe," acting Australian ambassador to the US
Graham Fletcher told the AFP news agency.</p>
            <p>Project Synergy was launched in the US in December 2012,
targeting the "upper echelon of dangerous designer drug trafficking
organisations," says a DEA statement.</p>
            <p>The drugs are often marketed as herbal incense or bath
salts.</p>
            <p>They are also sold as herbal blends, with chemicals that mimic
the effects of cannabis and can be smoked.</p>
            <p>"Designer synthetic drugs have caused significant organ damage
as well as overdose deaths," says the DEA.</p>
            <p>The millions of dollars in profits generated by the illegal
production and sale of synthetic drugs are sponsoring terror groups
in the Middle East, said Mr Capra.</p>
