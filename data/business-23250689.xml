            <p class="introduction">Italy's credit
worthiness has been downgraded by the ratings agency S&amp;P.</p>
            <p>It said the continued weakness of the Italian economy was behind
the cut, which saw the rating of government debt lowered to BBB
from BBB+.</p>
            <p>Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, has been in
recession since the middle of 2011 and unemployment is currently
running at more than 12%.</p>
            <p>S&amp;P said it expects the Italian economy to contract by 1.9%
this year, much worse than its previous forecast.</p>
            <p>The agency said that a lack of reform is partly to blame for
Italy's poor performance.</p>
            <p>"In our view, the low growth stems in large part from rigidities
in Italy's labour and product markets," S&amp;P said in a
statement.</p>
            <p>It supported that view with European Union data that showed
Italy's labour costs have risen more than any other eurozone
nation.</p>
            <p>Commenting on the downgrade on Italian television, Prime
Minister, Enrico Letta said: "It's proof that the situation is
still complex and Italy remains under special observation."</p>
