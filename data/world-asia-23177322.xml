            <p class="introduction">Five men have been
rescued in an Indonesian national park after spending five days
trapped in trees surrounded by Sumatran tigers, officials say.</p>
            <p>Dozens of rescuers, including police, arrived at the Mount
Leuser National Park on Sumatra Island to help the men.</p>
            <p>They moved in after tamers managed to drive the tigers away,
reports say.</p>
            <p>Several tigers attacked the group on Thursday after they
accidentally killed a tiger cub. A sixth man died in the initial
incident.</p>
            <p>Andi Basrul, head of the national park, said the survivors were
being transported to the nearest village, which normally takes six
hours on foot.</p>
            <p>Jamal Gayo, from the conservation group Leuser International
Foundation, said the five were weak after not having had food for
three days.</p>
            <p>The men had initially alerted nearby villagers using mobile
phones. Villagers tried to rescue the men on Thursday, but
retreated when they saw at least four large Sumatran tigers
circling the base of the tree.</p>
            <p>Officials had said it would take time before they could get to
the park, which covers nearly 7,930 sq km (3,060 sq miles) along
the border of North Sumatra and Aceh provinces.</p>
            <p>Earlier reports said the group, all from Simpang Kiri village in
Aceh Tamiang district, had set up deer traps for food, but
accidentally caught a tiger cub.</p>
            <p>The injured animal drew nearby tigers, who then pounced on the
men and killed a 28-year-old only identified as David.</p>
            <p>The smallest of all tigers, Sumatran tigers are a critically
endangered species only found on the Indonesian island.</p>
            <p>As few as 350 remain in the wild due to forest destruction and
poaching, of which the largest population lives in the Gunung
Leuser national park.</p>
