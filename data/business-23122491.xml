$160.6bn</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A Chinese bank has
topped a list of the world's top 1,000 banks for the first time,
according to a survey.</p>
            <p>ICBC moved up from third, switching places with last year's
winner, Bank of America. JP Morgan remained second.</p>
            <p>The closely watched annual report by The Banker is based on a
firm's Tier 1 capital, a key measurement of a bank's strength.</p>
            <p>The UK bank sector as a whole ranked 10th, behind France, Brazil
and Russia, and down from second in 2008.</p>
            <p>The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) moved into
pole position on the back of a 15% increase in capital to
$160.6bn.</p>
            <p>China Construction Bank, the country's second largest, also grew
its capital by 15%, to $137.6bn, and dislodged Citigroup from fifth
place.</p>
            <p>The UK's only bank in the top 10 is fourth-placed HSBC, with
capital of $151bn, which gains significant earnings from its Asian
operations.</p>
            <p>China now has 96 banks in the top 1000 ranking and holds four
places in the top 10.</p>
            <p>Its big four banks ICBC, CCB, Bank of China and Agricultural
Bank of China also head the table for the largest profits.</p>
            <p>ICBC saw profits surge 14% to $49.1bn in 2012.</p>
            <p>Brian Caplen, editor of The Banker, said: "For several years now
European and American banks have been stagnant and shrinking while
Chinese banks have been expanding in line with the growth in the
Chinese economy.</p>
            <p>"On most measures they now score as well or better than Western
banks but their big test will be how they cope as China's growth
slows over the next few years."</p>
            <p>The UK's banking sector now ranks 10th after seeing annual
profits plunge by 41% to $19.6bn. It was overtaken by France, which
now ranks eighth.</p>
            <p>Five years ago, UK banking profits stood at $85.2bn, according
to The Banker.</p>
            <p>Asian-focused Standard Chartered, which stands in 33rd place, is
the only major British bank to improve its performance in the
latest ranking, after profits rose 3%.</p>
            <p>Before the global financial crisis UK banks accounted for nearly
11% of global profits, in 2007, and now they account for just
2.61%</p>
            <p>Mr Caplen said: "UK banks always used to outperform in the
ranking but for the past several years they have been slipping
back.</p>
            <p>"The most successful British banks - HSBC and Standard Chartered
- rely on earnings from Asia and other emerging markets to maintain
their position."</p>
            <p>All but one of the 25 global banks with the greatest losses are
European banks, and six of the top 10 losses were from Spanish
banks</p>
            <p>However, the report showed that total profits of the top 1,000
banks are now back to their pre-crisis levels.</p>
