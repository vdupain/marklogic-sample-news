            <p class="introduction">Eleven local
officials have been detained over a fire at a poultry plant in
China's Jilin province that left 121 people dead, state media
say.</p>
            <p>The fire broke out at a slaughterhouse in Dehui early on 3
June.</p>
            <p>Local media reported that people struggled to escape because the
exits were blocked.</p>
            <p>It was China's deadliest fire since 2000, when 309 people died
in a blaze in a dance hall in Luoyang, in Henan province.</p>
            <p>Investigators said a short circuit ignited flammable materials
at the poultry plant, causing a blaze which spread rapidly. Dozens
of other people were hurt in the incident.</p>
            <p>A Xinhua news agency report said that the 11 officials had been
arrested on suspicion that "their derelictions of duty contributed
to a poultry plant fire".</p>
            <p>Those detained included the head of Dehui's Mishazi township,
where the factory was located, and the former head of the local
construction bureau, the agency said.</p>
            <p>Several fire department officials were also among those
detained, it said.</p>
            <p>"Some of the suspects... falsified information to hide the facts
that no serious fire safety inspections had been conducted and that
proper fire safety equipment was not in place," Xinhua said, citing
the Supreme People's Procuratorate.</p>
