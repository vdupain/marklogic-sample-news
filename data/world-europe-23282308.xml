            <p class="introduction">Russia's agency
responsible for the Kremlin security is buying typewriters - a move
reportedly prompted by recent leaks by WikiLeaks and Edward
Snowden.</p>
            <p>A 486,540-rouble (Ã‚Â£9,860) order for
electric typewriters has been placed by the FSO agency on the state
procurement website.</p>
            <p>The FSO has not commented on why it needs the old-fashioned
devices.</p>
            <p>But an agency source told Russia's Izvestiya newspaper the aim
was to prevent leaks from computer hardware.</p>
            <p>"After scandals with the distribution of secret documents by
WikiLeaks, the exposes by Edward Snowden, reports about Dmitry
Medvedev being bugged during his visit to the G20 London summit (in
2009), it has been decided to expand the practice of creating paper
documents," the source said.</p>
            <p>The source added that typewriters were already being used at
Russia's defence and emergencies ministries for drafts and secret
notes, and some reports had been prepared for President Vladimir
Putin by typewriter.</p>
            <p>Unlike printers, every typewriter had its own individual typing
pattern which made it possible to link every document to a
particular machine, Izvestiya said.</p>
            <p>Mr Snowden, a former CIA contractor, has recently leaked
thousands of classified US intelligence documents.</p>
            <p>He is currently on the run from the US authorities, and is
believed to be at Moscow's airport.</p>
            <p>WikiLeaks grabbed world headlines in 2010 by releasing hundreds
of thousands of US state department diplomatic cables, including
secret files relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
