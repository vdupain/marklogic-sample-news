            <p class="introduction">Mark Carney has
officially become head of the UK's central bank, replacing Sir
Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England.</p>
            <p>Mr Carney, who was head of Canada's central bank, is the first
foreigner to run the 319-year-old institution.</p>
            <p>He takes over with interest rates at an all-time low and with
several stimulus programmes in place to revive the economy
following the financial crisis.</p>
            <p>Mr Carney is likely to oversee the Bank's exit from these
measures.</p>
            <p>Financial markets are already braced for an end to the era of
cheap money as central banks such as the US Federal Reserve signal
a rise to more normal levels of interest rates over time.</p>
            <p>Since the economic crisis began in 2008, the Bank has kept
interest rates at historic lows and implemented quantitative easing
to inject Ã‚Â£375bn of liquidity into the
financial markets.</p>
            <p>Three members of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee,
including Sir Mervyn, have voted for an extra
Ã‚Â£25bn of QE at the past few meetings.</p>
            <p>Some analysts think the Bank may increase the stimulus programme
later in the year after Mr Carney takes over.</p>
            <p>Speaking about Mr Carney, former MPC member DeAnne Julius told
the BBC that "most sensible people realise that he can't wave a
magic wand and fix everything".</p>
            <p>She added: "It's just possible that he could be lucky, he could
be coming into this job at just the right moment because the
economy is recovering, financial markets are strong. He's probably,
as an outsider, the best person to change the culture in the Bank
of England - something that's been needed for a while. So I'm quite
optimistic.</p>
            <p>"I think we're lucky to have him," she added. "I think he has a
great track record from his Canadian experience. He's very well
known internationally.</p>
            <p>Mr Carney is respected for his handling of monetary policy in
Canada, which was also the only G7 nation not to have to bail out
its banks.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Sir Mervyn King was in charge at the Bank of England
for 10 years</span>
            </div>
            <p>In February, Mr Carney did not rule out changes to the way the
bank runs monetary policy but said the current policy of inflation
targeting had been the most successful.</p>
            <p>In announcing his appointment last year, Chancellor George
Osborne said Mr Carney was acknowledged as "the outstanding central
banker of his generation".</p>
            <p>Mr Carney was educated at the universities of Harvard and
Oxford. He spent 13 years with the investment bank Goldman Sachs
before taking over the Canadian central bank.</p>
            <p>He was once listed by Time Magazine as one of the 25 most
influential people in the world.</p>
            <p>A fluent French speaker, Mr Carney was appointed deputy governor
at the Bank of Canada in 2003, spending a year there before
becoming senior associate deputy minister of finance until his
appointment to the central bank's top job.</p>
            <p>He also serves as chairman of the Basel-based Financial
Stability Board (FSB) and as a member of the board of directors of
the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
            <p>Mr Carney's remuneration at the Bank of England includes a
salary of Ã‚Â£480,000, plus an annual pension
allowance of Ã‚Â£144,000 and a housing
allowance of Ã‚Â£250,000.</p>
            <p>The former head, Sir Mervyn, joined the Bank as its chief
economist in 1991 and became its deputy governor from 1998 to 2003,
when he took over the top job. He served 10 years as head of the
Bank.</p>
            <p>Under Sir Mervyn's watch, the Bank was criticised for failing to
spot that banks were over-extended and has also taken on more
responsibility for regulating the UK financial sector in the
aftermath of the crisis.</p>
            <p>The term for a Bank governor is eight years. But Mr Carney has
indicated he intends to serve for five years and stand down at the
end of June 2018.</p>
            <p>The Bank of Canada has named economist Stephen Poloz as his
replacement.</p>
