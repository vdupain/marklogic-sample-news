            <p class="introduction">A man has been charged after crashing his
car into the gates of the US embassy in the Australian capital,
Canberra.</p>
            <p>Adrian Richardson, 30, has been charged with damaging a
diplomatic residence following the incident, which happened on
Wednesday evening.</p>
            <p>He has also been ordered to undergo a mental health
evaluation.</p>
            <p>The incident caused a security scare, with fire-fighters,
police, ambulances and the bomb squad called to the scene.</p>
            <p>A prosecutor told a court hearing in Canberra on Thursday that
Mr Richardson turned off his lights, revved his engine and drove
straight at the gates of the embassy compound.</p>
            <p>The crash caused ''significant damage to the gate and breached
the perimeter of the embassy'', prosecutor Katrina Musgrove
said.</p>
            <p>Mr Richardson, who was not injured, had left an adult mental
health facility where he had been a resident shortly before the
incident, she said.</p>
            <p>He will face court at a later date.</p>
