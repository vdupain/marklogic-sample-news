            <p class="introduction">The role of Turkey's
security forces is being scrutinised again after their handling of
the mass anti-government unrest which focused on Istanbul.</p>
            <p>"Our police have successfully fulfilled their duties within the
confines of the law," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the
graduating class of the police academy on 26 June.</p>
            <p>"They have passed a very important test of democracy. They have
written a heroic saga."</p>
            <p>The prime minister's most loyal supporters will agree but
Turkish human rights activists argue that the unrest of recent
weeks tells a different story.</p>
            <p>The Turkish Doctors' Association says that four people were
killed and more than 8,000 people injured.</p>
            <p>Lawyers are still trying to compile definitive figures of those
detained. They accuse the interior ministry of not providing
accurate information. But campaigners believe that they have
gathered enough evidence in a number of cases to begin
investigating potential abuses of power.</p>
            <p>On 1 June, Ethem Sarisuluk, 27, was shot in the head in Ankara
during an anti-government demonstration. He died of his injuries
two weeks later.</p>
            <p>A forensic report revealed he had been
shot by a 9mm bullet, a type used by the Turkish police. Ahmet
Sahbaz was identified as the officer who fired the shot. A court
took Mr Sahbaz's statement and ordered his release pending
continuation of the case.</p>
            <p>"We don't hold out much hope of getting justice," says Kazim
Bayraktar, the lawyer for Ethem Sarisuluk's family.</p>
            <p>"The prosecutor will write the case based on a belief that the
police acted in self-defence. In his statement, the officer said:
'I thought I was going to be killed, I didn't directly shoot at
him.' But when you look at the footage, you see this is not
true."</p>
            <p>"The court is putting on a show," Mr Bayraktar adds. "We don't
expect anything from our national laws. We are already getting
prepared to go to the European Court of Human Rights."</p>
            <p>Others are preparing to do the same. One 26-year-old female
student, who asked us not to disclose her name, was caught in the
first police raid on Istanbul's Gezi Park on 31 May.</p>
            <p>"I was there with my cousin," she says.</p>

                 alt="A Turkish riot policeman uses tear gas on protesters in Taksim Square, 28 May"/>
               <span style="width:464px;">Police made heavy use of tear gas during
the protests</span>
            </div>
            <p>"We weren't doing anything. We didn't even demonstrate. The
police came into the park and tried to take an older woman who was
standing next to us. We asked the police what they were doing.</p>
            <p>"They took me and my cousin as well. They put us into a bus and
made us wait there for 18 hours. Tear gas from the clashes in the
park leaked into the bus."</p>
            <p>The student was then driven to a police station. An officer took
down her statement in the presence of her lawyer and was told that
she would be released. Her lawyer then left.</p>
            <p>At this point, officers appeared to change their mind. They held
the student overnight along with with six or seven other women. A
female police officer came and took away the woman's
belongings.</p>
            <p>"She took me to a dirty, dark, filthy room," the student
said.</p>
            <p>"She asked me to take off my top and then my underwear. I did
so. She asked me to crouch and cough. I did what she asked. This
went on for five minutes. I'd never been in custody before, so I
had no idea that I could have refused to do what she ordered."</p>
            <p>The student added that each of the other female detainees was
made to strip. They have now filed a complaint for sexual
harassment and abuse of authority, which they will take first to
the Turkish authorities, and then to the European Court of Human
Rights.</p>
            <p>"I am hopeful that we will win the case," says Ozlem Durucan,
the lawyer who represents three of the women, "These girls are all
young, they'd never been through anything like this before."</p>
            <p>In the aftermath of the eviction of Gezi Park on 16 June, the
police made many arrests - exactly how many is not yet clear.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Hundreds of protesters have been

            <p>The organisation Human Rights Watch says that it has documented
what it calls a huge wave of arbitrary detentions and police
attacks on people who were in a hospital and in makeshift health
clinics.</p>
            <p>One human rights lawyer in Istanbul has told the BBC that more
than 900 people in the country were taken into custody.</p>
            <p>Many were released after a few hours. Others were accused of a
range of crimes including organising violent protest, damaging
public property, disobeying the police and calling on people to
attend illegal demonstrations. Those charged with these crimes have
been released on bail pending trial.</p>
            <p>"There were not enough prosecutors, so people had to wait long
hours before they could give their statements," said Filiz
Kerestecioglu, a lawyer.</p>
            <p>"They were kept in buses for long hours. Police reinforcements
were sent from other cities to Istanbul. But not enough prosecutors
were brought in. People were detained because of the illegal acts
of the police, who kept the detainees longer than permitted."</p>
            <p>A number of people are still being held on more serious charges.
One lawyer says that 32 people in Istanbul have been charged with
"membership of an illegal organisation" or "aiding and abetting an
illegal organisation". The identity of these organisations has not
been disclosed.</p>
            <p>The Turkish government makes no apology for its actions against
protesters.</p>
            <p>"They [the police] will use all the authority given to them,"
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc told Turkish media.</p>
