            <p class="introduction">A genocide charge
against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has been
reinstated at the UN Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The Hague.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/11345">count of
genocide</a> relates to a campaign of killing and mistreating
non-Serbs in seven municipalities at the start of the Bosnian war
in 1992.</p>
            <p>The ruling means he now faces 11 charges, including a further
charge of genocide for the Srebrenica massacre.</p>
            <p>More than 7,500 Muslim men and boys died in the enclave in July
1995.</p>
            <p>It was the worst atrocity in Europe since the end of World War
II.</p>
            <p>The tribunal's decision was passed as thousands of people
gathered in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica for the burial of more
than 400 newly-identified victims of the 1995 massacre.</p>
            <p>Prior to Thursday's ruling, Mr Karadzic had been on trial for 10
charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
            <p>They include allegations that he orchestrated the shelling of
Sarajevo, and the use of 284 UN peacekeepers as human shields in
May and June 1995.</p>
            <p>The additional charge of genocide had been brought against him
over a campaign to drive hundreds of thousands of Bosnian Muslims
(also known as Bosniaks) and Croats out of large parts of Bosnia at
the start of the three-year war.</p>
            <p>It was dismissed by judges in June last year for lack of
evidence.</p>
            <p>But appeals judges now believe evidence
presented by the prosecution "could indicate that Karadzic
possessed genocidal intent" against Muslims and Croats, Judge
Theodor Meron said on Thursday.</p>
            <p>"The Appeals Chamber finds that the Trial Chamber erred in fact
in concluding that there was no evidence", Mr Meron said, adding
that the decision "resulted in a miscarriage of justice".</p>
            <p>The former Bosnian Serb leader was arrested in Belgrade in 2008
after 13 years on the run.</p>
            <p>He had been found living in disguise in Belgrade, under a false
name and working as a New Age healer. A bushy grey beard and thick
glasses had transformed his appearance.</p>
            <p>When Bosnia-Hercegovina became in independent state in 1992, Mr
Karadzic declared the creation of the independent Serbian Republic
of Bosnia and Hercegovina (renamed Republika Srpska) with its
capital in Pale, a suburb of Sarajevo, and himself as head of
state.</p>
            <p>His party, supported by Serbian then-President Slobodan
Milosevic, organised Serbs to fight against the Bosniaks and Croats
in Bosnia.</p>
            <p>A vicious war ensued, in which Serbs besieged Sarajevo for 44
months, shelling Muslim forces but also terrorising the civilian
population with a relentless bombardment and sniper fire. Thousands
of civilians died, many of them deliberately targeted.</p>
            <p>Bosnian Serb forces - assisted by paramilitaries from Serbia
proper - also expelled hundreds of thousands of Muslims and Croats
from their homes in a brutal campaign of "ethnic cleansing".
Numerous atrocities were documented, including the widespread rape
of Bosniak women and girls.</p>
