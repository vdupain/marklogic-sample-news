            <p class="introduction">G8 leaders meeting
in Northern Ireland have backed calls for Syrian peace talks to be
held in Geneva "as soon as possible".</p>
            <p>After adopting a statement, UK Prime Minister David Cameron said
the leaders had managed "to overcome fundamental differences".</p>
            <p>But no timetable for the Geneva talks was given.</p>
            <p>The statement does not mention what role Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad could play in the future.</p>

            <p>Russia is backing President Assad, while the US and its European
allies are supporting the rebels.</p>
            <p>Earlier on Tuesday, the Kremlin insisted that each of the Syrian
sides at the Geneva talks should be able to select their own
delegations, sidestepping questions about whether this could leave
open a role for Mr Assad.</p>
            <p>The communique is largely a reaffirmation of what was said at
the Geneva Conference in June 2012, reports the BBC's Jonathan
Marcus at the summit in Enniskillen.</p>
            <p>The G8 leaders agreed the joint statement on Syria after lengthy
discussions at the end their two-day summit.</p>
            <p>The seven-point document says that any future transitional
government should be "formed by mutual consent".</p>
            <p>It stresses that the leaders are united
in wanting a negotiated and peaceful end to the conflict that will
produce a government "under a top leadership that inspires public
confidence."</p>
            <p>However, both Russia and the West could interpret such phrasing
as their diplomatic success at the summit, correspondents say.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin refused to support any statement making Mr Assad's
removal from power an explicit goal.</p>
            <p>But speaking to reporters after the summit, President Putin said
he did not feel "isolated" in Enniskillen despite clashing with
other leaders.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Mr Cameron pledged at a separate news
conference "to learn the lessons from Iraq" by making sure key
institutions of the state are maintained through any
transition.</p>
            <p>The prime minister said it was important to send a signal to the
Syrian people that there would be a functioning state once Mr Assad
was gone.</p>
            <p>This could be seen as encouragement to the Assad supporters
perhaps to begin thinking about a future without him, says our
correspondent.</p>
            <p>The joint statement also condemns "any
use of chemical weapons in Syria" and urges both Damascus and the
rebels at the Geneva conference "to commit to destroying and
expelling from Syria all organisations and individuals affiliated
to al-Qaeda and any other non-state actors linked to
terrorism".</p>
            <p>On the humanitarian front, the G8 leaders agreed to provide
nearly $1.5bn (Ã‚Â£960m) in new funds to help
people affected by the raging conflict.</p>
            <p>More than 4.25 million people have been displaced since the
Syrian conflict began in March 2011.</p>
            <p>More than 90,000 people have been killed, according to UN
estimates.</p>
            <p>In Enniskillen, the leaders also signed a declaration committing
themselves to "fight the scourge of tax evasion" and promote free
trade.</p>
