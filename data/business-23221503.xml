            <p class="introduction">Talks aimed at
creating the world's largest free trade zone between the European
Union and the US are set to open amid tensions over spying and
protected industries.</p>
            <p>The talks come at a time of growing friction over snooping by
the US National Security Agency on its allies.</p>
            <p>France has demanded protection for its film and television
industry.</p>
            <p>The Washington talks will aim to remove trade and investment
barriers between the United States and the EU.</p>
            <p>German Chancellor, Angela Merkel said on Thursday that the talks
remain the "highest priority".</p>
            <p>Direct tariffs on goods and services between the two are already
low, but there are other barriers such as regulatory and safety
standards, inspection procedures, and preferences for domestic
business.</p>
            <p>Removing these could significantly reduce the costs for
companies doing transatlantic business.</p>
            <p>For example, European negotiators will be pushing for US states,
cities and federal departments to drop preferences for American
contractors.</p>
            <p>In turn, Washington will be looking for the EU to open up its
market to US biotechnology firms wanting to sell products like
genetically-modified foods, something which remains controversial
in Europe.</p>
            <p>"These negotiations will not always be easy but I am sure they
will be worth it," Jose Manuel Barroso, the head of the European
Commission, said at the Group of Eight conference last month, when
the two sides officially agreed to open talks.</p>
            <p>Last year, trade in goods between the United States and the EU
was worth some 500bn euros ($650bn), with another 280bn euros
($359bn) in services and trillions in investment flows.</p>
