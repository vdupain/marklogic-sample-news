            <p class="introduction">A US man has
devoured 69 hot dogs, beating his own world record at an annual 4
July competition at Coney Island in New York.</p>
            <p>Joey "Jaws" Chestnut ate the sausages with buns in 10 minutes,
breaking his old record of 68 and winning the world title for the
seventh year in a row.</p>
            <p>In the women's contest, Sonya Thomas kept her title with nearly
37 sausages.</p>
            <p>The first such hot dog eating contest was held in 1916, when the
winner put away only 13 frankfurters.</p>
            <p>On Thursday, thousands of spectators cheered on the competitors
of the 97th Nathan's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog
Eating Contest.</p>
            <p>Mr Chestnut's main rival, Matt "Megatoad" Stonie, only managed
51 hot dogs.</p>
            <p>"I feel a little full," Mr Chestnut, 29, who weighs in at 210lb
(95kg), joked after his victory. "I'm happy as heck. Things
couldn't have gone much better."</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Ms Thomas, known as The Black Widow, beat her closest
competitor by three-quarters of a sausage. But she was not able to
match her feat of last year when she ate 45 sausages.</p>
            <p>"It was very hot water, maybe too hot," said the 45-year-old,
who weighs just 100lb. "I think it made me sick because I had to
dunk in the water the buns, right? Then I tried to eat."</p>
            <p>The competition contest was broadcast live on sports channel
ESPN, and featured much of the fanfare usually reserved for
professional sporting events.</p>
