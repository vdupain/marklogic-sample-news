            <p class="introduction">More than one in two
people think corruption has worsened over the last two years,
according to a public opinion survey by Transparency International.
Its annual Global Corruption Barometer found 27% of respondents
said they had paid a bribe when accessing public services and
institutions in the last year. The survey covered more than 100
countries. Perhaps it's time to challenge our perceptions of
corruption, writes BBC Newshour's Tim Franks.</p>
            <p>The evidence suggests a global pandemic, a disease which infects
and corrodes and rots. Most people appear to think it's getting
worse. And yet the reaction is often just a tut - it's other
people's problem, or a shrug - it's always been with us and it
always will be.</p>
            <p>It is corruption.</p>
            <p>It is an act, a fact of life, which occurs - by and large - in
the shadows. Some, though, are trying doggedly to draw back the
curtain - among them, the Berlin-based pressure group, Transparency
International. Its latest global survey of corruption covered 107
countries and 114,000 people. And most of them say that corruption
has worsened over the last two years.</p>
            <p>There are some depressing, if
predictable, trends. You are twice as likely to pay a bribe in a
poor country as a rich one. In one in three countries, the
greasiest palms belong to the police. In almost one in five, the
judiciary. Overall, one in four people surveyed say they have paid
a bribe.</p>
            <p>Nor is it simply about discreetly folding money into an
official's palm. It is political parties, "the driving force of
democracies", as TI calls them, which are perceived to be the most
corrupt public institution.</p>
            <p>That is, in large part, because corruption is not just about
bribery. Almost two out of three people say they believe personal
relationships are what help get things done in the public sector -
one in two say their government is largely or completely run by
special interest groups.</p>

            <p>And the smell does not just hang around
emerging democracies or economies. <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2013/05/11/freshman-lawmakers-are-introduced-permanent-hunt-for-campaign-money/YQMMMoqCNxGKh2h0tOIF9H/story.html">
A sentence in the Boston Globe</a> two months ago made me do a
double-take - newly elected Democrat members of the House of
Representatives were told by their party "to devote at least four
hours a day to the tedious task of raising money".</p>
            <p>You may argue that that is not corruption. It is an open trawl.
There are rules against offering a clear quid pro quo. But the TI
survey finds that people in the US, as with the UK, believe
corruption is growing. And in the UK, while - full disclosure here
- it's the media who are seen as the most venal sector of public
life, they're run a close second by political parties.</p>

                 alt="British politician Lord Danby (seated left) offers a bribe of 1,000 guineas to the British poet and MP Andrew Marvell - circa 1660"/>
               <span style="width:464px;">This engraving of British politician
Lord Danby offering a bribe to an MP in the 17th Century shows
political corruption has long been an issue of public
concern</span>
            </div>
            <p>There are some oases. People in Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Georgia,
Sudan and South Sudan report that corruption has lessened over the
last two years.</p>
            <p>TI argues, incontrovertibly, if a little
optimistically, that for the stench of corruption to be lifted
further, "governments must set up accountability mechanisms" and
"people should refuse to pay a bribe, wherever asked and whenever
possible".</p>
            <p>Others may argue that beyond the familiar figures of the
grasping politician, dodgy hack and bent policeman, corruption is
more amorphous and more pervasive. The Harvard moral philosopher,
Michael Sandel, draws an almost Shakespearean image of the
corruption of the social fabric <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/04/what-isnt-for-sale/308902/">
when he writes of prisoners paying to upgrade their cell, or
patients paying to jump the queue at public hospitals, or schools
paying children $2 a pop to read books</a>.</p>
            <p>Perhaps in the first instance, we should
all challenge our preconceptions about the places, the situations,
the morality, even the language of corruption. That it isn't just
something that other people do. Or it's not just something that
everyone does - a fee, rather than a bribe, whether you're paying
or taking.</p>
            <p>More than 200 years ago, the great political thinker Edmund
Burke warned that "among a people generally corrupt, liberty cannot
long exist". If that is right, corruption deserves more than a tut
or a shrug.</p>
            <p>
               <em>There will be a series of special reports and articles this
week as the BBC examines why bribes and backhanders are part of the
system in so much of the world, looks at countries which have tried
to roll back the tide - and explains how corruption works.</em>
