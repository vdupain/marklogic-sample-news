other French intelligence agencies</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">France's foreign
intelligence service intercepts computer and telephone data on a
vast scale, like the controversial US Prism programme, according to
the French daily Le Monde.</p>
            <p>The data is stored on a supercomputer at the headquarters of the
DGSE intelligence service, the paper says.</p>
            <p>The operation is "outside the law, and beyond any proper
supervision", Le Monde says.</p>
            <p>Other French intelligence agencies allegedly access the data
secretly.</p>
            <p>It is not clear however whether the DGSE surveillance goes as
far as Prism. So far French officials have not commented on Le
Monde's allegations.</p>
            <p>The DGSE allegedly analyses the "metadata" - not the contents of
e-mails and other communications, but the data revealing who is
speaking to whom, when and where.</p>
            <p>Connections inside France and between France and other countries
are all monitored, Le Monde reports.</p>
            <p>The paper alleges the data is being stored on three basement
floors of the DGSE building in Paris. The secret service is the
French equivalent of Britain's MI6.</p>
            <p>The operation is designed, say experts, to uncover terrorist
cells. But the scale of it means that "anyone can be spied on, any
time", Le Monde says.</p>
            <p>There is a continuing international furore over revelations that
the US has been systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and
web data.</p>
            <p>The French government has sharply criticised the US spying,
which allegedly included eavesdropping on official EU
communications.</p>
            <p>The scale of surveillance by America's National Security Agency
(NSA) emerged from classified intelligence documents leaked by
whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p>
            <p>The UK spy agency GCHQ is reported to run a similarly vast data
collection operation, co-operating closely with the NSA.</p>
