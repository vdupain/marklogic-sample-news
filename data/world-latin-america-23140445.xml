            <p class="introduction">Tickets for next
year's World Cup in Brazil will be "cheapest ever", football's
governing body Fifa says.</p>
            <p>Fifa Secretary-General Jerome Valcke said 70% of the matches
would cost less than in previous events; ticket prices will be
announced on 19 July.</p>
            <p>Mr Valcke and Fifa President Sepp Blatter praised the
Confederations Cup in Brazil which ended on Sunday.</p>
            <p>The tournament was marked by protests against the high cost of
the World Cup, corruption and poor public services.</p>
            <p>Mr Blatter said the Confederations Cup was a success despite the
demonstrations which took millions to the streets.</p>
            <p>"I am happy we come to a conclusion now with a sporting result
and the impression that the social unrest is now resting - I don't
know how long for," he told reporters in Rio de Janeiro on
Monday.</p>
            <p>The head of Fifa also admitted there had been fears that Brazil
would not be ready for the World Cup in 2014.</p>
            <p>Building work at some stadiums was finished shortly before the
start of the Confederations Cup and there were doubts about how the
country's infra-structure would cope with a large scale event.</p>
            <p>"When we started the competition there was some uncertainty what
would happen," Mr Blatter said.</p>
            <p>Fifa officials avoided commenting on security issues, saying
they were a matter for the government to deal with.</p>
            <p>During the Confederations Cup there have been several clashes
between protesters and security forces, who fired rubber bullets,
pepper spray and tear gas into the crowds.</p>
            <p>There were reports that the public was affected by the gas
inside the stadiums, including Rio's Maracana, where Brazil beat
Spain 3-0 in Sunday's final.</p>
            <p>Fifa was one of the targets of protesters, who complained that
football's governing body gained profits exempt from tax and that
high investments of public funds in the preparation for the
international football events would have been better used for
hospitals or schools.</p>
