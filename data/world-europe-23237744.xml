contract</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The head of Russia's
Bolshoi Theatre has been removed from his post, following a series
of scandals including an acid attack on the ballet company's
artistic director.</p>
            <p>Anatoly Iksanov is to be replaced by Vladimir Urin, the Russian
culture ministry announced.</p>
            <p>The acid attack on Sergei Filin exposed vicious internal
rivalries at one of the world's top ballet companies.</p>
            <p>Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said the Bolshoi needed
"renewal".</p>
            <p>"A difficult situation had developed around the theatre and the
troupe - everything pointed to the need for renewal," he said.</p>
            <p>Mr Iksanov had been accused of mismanaging the Bolshoi's $1bn
(Ã‚Â£860m) renovation - which ran years over
schedule and over budget.</p>
            <p>He had also become embroiled in a war of words with dancer
Nikolai Tsiskaridze.</p>
            <p>Mr Tsiskaridze, a principal dancer and teacher at the Bolshoi,
complained of corruption and called for the theatre's entire
management to be sacked and for himself to be put in charge.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Nikolai Tsiskaridze demanded he be put in charge of
the Bolshoi</span>
            </div>
            <p>Mr Iksanov hit back, suggesting Mr Tsiskaridze might have played
a role in inciting the attack on Mr Filin, which left him with
severe burns to his face and almost completely blinded.</p>
            <p>Mr Tsiskaridze has denied having anything to do with the attack,
for which three other people are awaiting trial.</p>
            <p>But he has been told his contract at the theatre will not be
renewed.</p>
            <p>Mr Iksanov had been the head of the Bolshoi Theatre for the last
13 years, and had more than a year of his contract to run.</p>
            <p>Culture Minister Mr Medinsky said he would still have a role
advising his successor, Mr Urin, who has been general director of
the Stanislavsky Musical Theatre.</p>
            <p>Mr Urin "will be able to unite the troupe and continue the
development of the best theatre in the country and one of the best
in the world," Mr Medinsky said.</p>
            <p>Commenting on his appointment, Mr Urin said "I don't plan any
revolutions and understand perfectly that in this theatre, as in
any other, one person alone cannot do anything.</p>
            <p>"I very much hope that the majority of people working in this
theatre - talented, remarkable people - will be my allies," he
said.</p>
