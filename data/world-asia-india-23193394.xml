            <p class="introduction">The trial of a
17-year-old, accused in last December's fatal gang rape of a woman
on a bus in Delhi, has concluded.</p>
            <p>The Juvenile Justice Board will give its verdict on 11 July.
<a href="/news/world-asia-india-21229331"
               title="Family of gang rape accused 'made infamous' in home village">The
boy</a> was charged with rape, murder and other crimes, including
kidnapping.</p>
            <p>If convicted, he faces a maximum of three years in a reform
facility.</p>
            <p>He has denied the charges - as have four other suspects on trial
at a specially convened fast-track court. They face the death
penalty.</p>
            <p>A sixth suspect <a href="/news/world-asia-india-21751887"
               title="Body of India rape suspect released">was found dead in jail.</a>
Prison officials said they believed he hanged himself. Defence
lawyers and his family allege he was murdered.</p>
            <p>The brutal assault shocked India and sparked a debate over the
treatment of women in the country.</p>
            <p>The victim, a physiotherapy student who cannot be named in India
for legal reasons, and a male friend were attacked on a bus on 16
December.</p>
            <p>Police said the assailants beat both of them, and then raped the
woman. She suffered massive internal injuries and died nearly two
weeks later.</p>
