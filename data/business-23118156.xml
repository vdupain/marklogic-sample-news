bad debts have increased</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">China's banking
system is stable, despite ongoing fears of a "credit crunch"
spooking financial markets, according to the country's top
regulator.</p>
            <p>"The issue with tight liquidity in the interbank market has
started to ease," said the head of the China Banking Regulatory
Commission, Shang Fulin.</p>
            <p>Fears over bad bank loans sent Chinese stocks to a
four-and-a-half-year low last week.</p>
            <p>Global markets also fell sharply.</p>
            <p>Concern over bad loans in the economy led to a spike in
interbank rates, which are the interest rates banks charge each
other on a daily basis and a sign of how much faith that banks have
in each other.</p>
            <p>For example, a spike in the London-based Libor benchmark lending
rate preceded the start of the 2008 financial crisis as US and UK
banks refused to lend each other as the scale of bad debts became
apparent.</p>
            <p>"Recently some foreign institutions and industry players showed
concern about risk in areas including local government debts," Mr
Shang said on Saturday.</p>
            <p>"As long as we apply the right risk-management measures, these
risks are controllable."</p>
            <p>China has been trying to impose more discipline on its banks
amid fears of bad loans impacting on its economy.</p>
            <p>After the global financial crisis, Chinese banks - led by the
state-owned institutions - lent out record sums of money in an
attempt to help maintain China's rapid growth rate.</p>
            <p>There are fears that the availability of easy money may have
created asset bubbles - especially in the property sector.</p>
            <p>And if China's growth slows fast, or if asset prices decline
sharply, some borrowers may not be able to repay some of these
loans.</p>
            <p>"These days the issue with tight liquidity in the interbank
market has started to ease," Mr Shang said. "This situation will
not affect the overall pattern of stable operations in the domestic
banking sector."</p>
            <p>He added that Chinese financial institutions had excess reserves
of 1.5 trillion yuan ($244bn; Ã‚Â£160bn) as of
28 June.</p>
            <p>On Friday, China's National Audit Office said that some
state-owned banks had "violated" lending regulations, saying 28.4bn
yuan of loans had been issued by some banks for projects without
proper procedures or necessary guarantees.</p>
