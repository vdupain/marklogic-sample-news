            <p class="introduction">Despicable Me 2 has
topped the US box office chart, beating Johnny Depp's The Lone
Ranger to the top spot.</p>
            <p>The Universal Pictures animation sequel made $82.5m
(Ã‚Â£55.4m) over the weekend according to
early estimates.</p>
            <p>Disney's Lone Ranger, starring Depp as Tonto in a reboot of the
radio and TV series, took just $29.5m
(Ã‚Â£19.8m).</p>
            <p>Dave Hollis, Disney's head of distribution, said: "We thought it
would appeal to a broader audience than it did."</p>
            <p>The film, which has received poor reviews from critics,
reportedly cost at least $225m (Ã‚Â£151m) to
make.</p>
            <p>The majority of the film's audience in its debut weekend were
over 25 years of age.</p>
            <p>"You think you have everything in place,"
said Hollis.</p>
            <p>"Even when you have all the ingredients for what you think will
be a four-quadrant 'everybody' picture, sometimes it doesn't work
out that way."</p>
            <p>Despicable Me 2 stars Steve Carell as a villain who becomes a
stay-at-home dad.</p>
            <p>The family film features the now famous little yellow creatures
called minions.</p>
            <p>Nikki Rocco, head of distribution, said a third Despicable Me
film was in the pipeline.</p>
            <p>"The minions steal everybody's heart," said Rocco. "It's a great
time of year to release a family film with broad appeal."</p>
            <p>Last week's number one, female cop comedy The Heat starring
Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, fell to third place taking
$25m (Ã‚Â£16.7m).</p>
            <p>Monsters University and Brad Pitt's World War Z rounded out the
top five.</p>
