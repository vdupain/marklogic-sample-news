            <p class="introduction">Secondary schools
have been ordered to close across Nigeria's north-eastern state of
Yobe after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed
22 students and torched their school.</p>
            <p>Yobe Governor Ibrahim Gaidam condemned as "cold-blooded murder"
Saturday's attack on the Mamudo boarding school.</p>
            <p>Nigeria blamed Islamist militant group Boko Haram - which
targeted two schools in the region in June - for the attack.</p>
            <p>The group's name translates as "Western education is
forbidden".</p>
            <p>Dozens of schools have been burned in attacks by Islamists since
2010.</p>
            <p>Visiting the school on Sunday, Mr Gaidam described the attackers
as "callous and devoid of any shred of humanity".</p>
            <p>He ordered the state's secondary schools to be closed until the
start of the new academic term in September, to allow state and
federal government officials as well as community leaders to work
on ways to guarantee the safety of schools.</p>
            <p>He also called on the government to lift a blocking of mobile
phone signals across the state.</p>
            <p>"Lack of [Global System for Mobile Communications] service has
prevented patriotic citizens who have hitherto been collaborating
with security agents from reporting suspicious movements in their
neighbourhoods," said Mr Gaidam in a statement.</p>
            <p>Yobe is one of three states where President Goodluck Jonathan
declared a state of emergency in May, sending thousands of troops
to the area.</p>
            <p>Eyewitnesses said some of the victims were burned alive in
Saturday's attack, while others were shot as they tried to
flee.</p>
            <p>A reporter from the Associated Press found chaotic scenes at the
hospital in nearby Potiskum, where traumatised parents struggled to
identify their children among the charred bodies and gunshot
victims.</p>
            <p>Survivors said suspected militants arrived with containers full
of fuel and set fire to the school.</p>
            <p>Mr Gaidam ordered that those injured in the attack be given free
medical attention.</p>
            <p>More than 600 people were believed to have been killed in 2012
by Boko Haram, which is fighting to overthrow the government and
create an Islamic state in Nigeria's predominantly Muslim
north.</p>
