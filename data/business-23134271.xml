anniversary in March</span>

            <p class="introduction">Steinway, maker of
the famous pianos, is being acquired for $438m
(Ã‚Â£288m) by the private equity firm Kohlberg
&amp; Co.</p>
            <p>The 160-year old firm had previously announced it was looking
for a buyer.</p>
            <p>Steinway Musical Instruments also produces Bach Stradivarius
trumpets, Selmer Paris saxophones, and CG Conn French horns, and
holds more than 127 patents for musical instruments.</p>
            <p>Kohlberg will pay $35 per share, 15% more than the stock's
closing price on Friday of $30.43.</p>
            <p>"Our agreement with Kohlberg represents an exceptional valuation
for our shareholders," said Michael Sweeney, chairman and interim
chief executive.</p>
            <p>Shares in the firm were up more than 15% following the
announcement, and have risen more than 70% this year.</p>
            <p>The company, which was founded in 1853 in lower Manhattan by
German immigrant Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (later Henry E.
Steinway), still has manufacturing facilities in Astoria, Queens
and Hamburg, Germany.</p>
            <p>Kohlberg partner Christopher Anderson said the firm was looking
to help Steinway expand globally, "while ensuring the artisanal
manufacturing processes that make the company's products unique are
preserved, celebrated and treasured".</p>
