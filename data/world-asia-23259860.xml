Shaikh's escort and detonated the explosives when the security
chief stopped to get out of his vehicle</span>

            <p class="introduction">The chief security
officer of Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has been killed in
a bomb attack in the port city of Karachi, police say.</p>
            <p>Bilal Shaikh and two other aides died in the blast, which took
place near an office of Mr Zardari's Pakistan People's Party
(PPP).</p>
            <p>Several more people are reported to have been wounded in the
explosion.</p>
            <p>An active member of the PPP, Mr Sheikh was responsible for the
safety of Mr Zardari's son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.</p>
            <p>Mr Sheikh had survived an assassination attempt near his home in
Karachi about a year ago.</p>
            <p>The president's residence is also in the city, which has been
plagued by violent turf wars between rival political groups and
heavily armed gangs linked to them.</p>
            <p>Authorities said initial investigations showed it was a suicide
attack.</p>
            <p>Security forces cordoned off the area in the Guru Mandir
neighbourhood in central Karachi, following Wednesday's
bombing.</p>
            <p>A police escort was accompanying Mr Sheikh's white armoured car
when the attack took place.</p>

            <p>Officials said the bomber was thought to have followed the
vehicles and detonated the explosives when the security chief
stopped to get out of his car.</p>
            <p>"It seems that the suicide attacker walked up to Sheikh's
vehicle and blew himself up outside the front passenger seat of the
vehicle where Sheikh was seated," police officer Raja Umar Khattab
said.</p>
            <p>No group has said it was behind the bombing.</p>
            <p>There has been a series of attacks blamed on Islamist groups,
including the Pakistan Taliban, around the country since the new
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was sworn in last month.</p>
            <p>Mr Sharif, who has pledged new action on terrorism, is under
mounting pressure to explain how he intends stopping the bloodshed,
observers say.</p>
