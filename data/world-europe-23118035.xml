            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Croatia has become
the 28th member of the European Union, with crowds joining
celebrations in the capital Zagreb.</p>
            <p>Fireworks lit the sky as membership became effective at midnight
(22:00 GMT), with President Ivo Josipovic describing the event as
historic.</p>
            <p>It comes almost two decades after Croatia's brutal war of
independence.</p>
            <p>But correspondents say enthusiasm for the EU in the country has
been dampened by the eurozone crisis, and Croatia's own economic
problems.</p>
            <p>Celebrations took place in the central
square of Zagreb, with fireworks and music including Beethoven's
Ode to Joy, the European anthem.</p>
            <p>"Welcome to the European Union!" European Commission President
Jose Manuel Barroso said in Croatian to the cheering crowd.</p>
            <p>President Josipovic said it was "a great and joyful day for our
homeland".</p>
            <p>"This the day when we open a new chapter in the thick book of
our history," he added.</p>
            <p>Earlier he told a meeting of EU and regional leaders: "The
accession of Croatia to the European Union is confirmation that
each one of us belongs to the European democratic and cultural set
of values."</p>
            <p>Croatian officials then unveiled EU signs and removed customs
posts at the borders with Slovenia, the first former Yugoslav
republic to have joined the bloc, and with Hungary.</p>
            <p>Croatia is the first new EU member since Bulgaria and Romania
joined in 2007. It is 10 years since it applied.</p>
            <p>Croatia's split from Yugoslavia triggered a 1991-1995 war to
secure its independence.</p>
            <p>But with one in five unemployed and Croatia's national debt
officially classed as junk, some Croatians feel joining an economic
bloc with its own serious troubles will do little to improve their
prospects.</p>
            <p>"Just look what's happening in Greece and Spain! Is this where
we're headed?" asked pensioner Pavao Brkanovic in a market in the
capital.</p>
            <p>"You need illusions to be joyful, but the illusions have long
gone," he told Reuters news agency.</p>
            <p>Concerns about Croatian corruption and organised crime remain
among some EU leaders, and Croatia will not yet join the single
currency or the free-movement Schengen zone, where most EU citizens
are not subject to passport checks.</p>
            <p>But advocates of EU membership say
despite this, their case remains a persuasive one.</p>
            <p>Two-thirds of Croatians voted in favour of accession last
year.</p>
            <p>"It's important for us primarily for the long term guarantees of
political stability and then everything else - the single market
too," Croatia's First Deputy Prime Minister, Vesna Pusic, told the
BBC.</p>
            <p>The EU itself has given Croatia a clean bill of health - and
praised reforms which improve the rule of law and tackle
corruption.</p>
            <p>It hopes the other countries of the former Yugoslavia will be
encouraged to join - and secure long-term peace for an historically
turbulent region, reports the BBC's regional correspondent Guy De
Launey.</p>

            <p>Thousands of people were in Zagreb's main square for the
accession ceremony.</p>
            <p>They enjoyed performances ranging from traditional dance to hip
hop - culminating in a stirring rendition of the EU anthem Ode To
Joy at midnight, as Croatia officially became the 28th member
state.</p>
            <p>But the square was not as packed as it might have been, had
accession taken place a few years ago. Economic crises at home and
within the EU have made many Croatians ambivalent about
membership.</p>
            <p>Some said the plight of their fellow Balkan country - and now
fellow EU member - Bulgaria made them worried about what might
happen to Croatia. Others said the accession process had taken so
long - almost a decade - that they no longer cared.</p>
            <p>But other Croatians were more enthusiastic - especially those
whose lives or businesses involve crossing borders. For them, EU
membership should reduce paperwork and hassle - reason enough to
celebrate.</p>
