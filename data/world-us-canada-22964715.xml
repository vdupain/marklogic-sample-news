            <p class="introduction">Top US journalist
and war correspondent Michael Hastings has died in car crash in Los
Angeles aged 33, his employer, news website BuzzFeed, has
confirmed.</p>
            <p>His vehicle hit a tree and caught fire on Tuesday morning, US
media report.</p>
            <p>The reporter was best known for his <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-runaway-general-20100622"
               title="Rolling Stone Magazine">award-winning profile</a> in Rolling
Stone magazine of ex-US Afghanistan commander General Stanley
McChrystal.</p>
            <p>The military leader was dismissed after he openly criticised
President Barack Obama in the story.</p>
            <p>Gen McChrystal later quipped about the incident, telling
military staff during his Pentagon farewell address: "I have
stories on all of you, photos of many, and I know a Rolling Stone
reporter."</p>
            <p>The accident which killed Mr Hastings is thought to have
occurred on Highland Avenue in the Hancock Park neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>Authorities confirmed a man had been killed in a car crash there
on Tuesday morning, but would not confirm his identity.</p>
            <p>BuzzFeed's editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, said he had learnt the
news from a family member.</p>
            <p>"We are shocked and devastated by the news that Michael Hastings
is gone," Mr Smith said.</p>
            <p>"Michael was a great, fearless journalist with an incredible
instinct for the story, and a gift for finding ways to make his
readers care about anything he covered from wars to
politicians."</p>
            <p>At the time of his death, Mr Hastings was also still a
contributing editor at Rolling Stone.</p>
            <p>"I'm sad that I'll never get to publish all the great stories
that he was going to write, and sad that he won't be stopping by my
office for any more short visits which would stretch for two or
three completely engrossing hours", the magazine's managing editor
Will Dana said.</p>
            <p>Mr Hastings began his career at Newsweek magazine in 2002, and
was named the publication's Baghdad correspondent in 2005.</p>
            <p>His work has also appeared in The Washington Post, the LA Times
and numerous publications.</p>
