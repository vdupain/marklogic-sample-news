            <p class="introduction">US airlines have
cancelled flights into and out of Mexico City for a second day over
fears that ash from a rumbling volcano could affect their
planes.</p>
            <p>Delta and United Airlines were among the companies that stopped
at least a dozen flights on Friday.</p>
            <p>On Thursday, more than 40 flights were cancelled, leaving
hundreds of passengers stranded.</p>
            <p>Popocatepetl volcano has been rumbling all year, and began
spewing ash and steam earlier in the week.</p>
            <p>Airport authorities insisted there was no danger.</p>
            <p>An unnamed airport official told the AFP news agency: "There is
a very thin presence of ash, which does not harm operations or
affect equipment."</p>

to wait for hours at Mexico City airport</span>
            </div>
            <p>But Jorge Andres Gomez, a spokesman for the airport, said any
change in the wind or intensity of the volcano would complicate the
situation.</p>
            <p>US Airways, Delta, United, American and Alaska Airlines all
cancelled flights on Thursday.</p>
            <p>The routes affected by the cancellations were flights to
Houston, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, Chicago and Los Angeles.</p>
            <p>American said in a statement that it had taken the action as a
precaution.</p>
            <p>"We are closely monitoring the situation in Mexico City as
volcanic ash continues to be emitted from Popocatepetl," said
American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller.</p>
            <p>Mexican airlines continued to fly into the airport as
scheduled.</p>
            <p>Most operations were getting back to normal later on Friday,
officials said.</p>
            <p>The authorities established an 11-km (seven-mile) no-go zone
around the volcano, which lies 70km (40 miles) south-east of the
airport.</p>
            <p>Popocatepetl, which is 5,452m (17,900ft) high, has intensified
in activity since May, and the alert level is currently set one
notch below evacuation level.</p>
            <p>Mexico's National Disaster Prevention Centre reported tremors
and columns of ash and vapour at Popocatepetl on Friday.</p>
            <p>It advised people living around the volcano to take precautions
such as using masks, covering water supplies and staying
indoors.</p>
