            <p class="introduction">At least nine people
have died in gun battles with drug dealers in a favela (shanty
town) in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, police say.</p>
            <p>The clashes started on Monday evening after a demonstration in
Bonsucesso, which reportedly ended in mass robberies near Rio's
main access road.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of police and National Guard officers, with the support
of a tank, are being deployed to secure the area.</p>
            <p>Police say at least six of the victims were suspects and one was
a policeman.</p>
            <p>At least nine others were arrested during the operation in the
Favela da Mare area, and a number of guns and drugs were
confiscated, police say.</p>
            <p>The violence broke out on Monday evening, after a peaceful
demonstration ended in mass robberies.</p>
            <p>Shops, passers-by and demonstrators were robbed by a group of
criminals, police say.</p>
            <p>The gang went on to shortly block one lane of Avenida Brasil,
Rio's main access road, before running into Favela da Mare, police
say.</p>
            <p>The clashes took place as police followed the group into the
favela.</p>
            <p>A man who was returning home was shot in the head, according to
local reports.</p>
            <p>A police officer and another seven civilians also died in the
clashes.</p>
            <p>Local schools remained shut on Tuesday, affecting thousands of
children.</p>
            <p>The Mare area comprises a series of interlinked shanty towns
which are home to more than 130,000 people.</p>
            <p>Rio de Janeiro's pacification programme, which promotes
occupation of shanty towns to push out drug trafficking gangs, has
not yet reached the area.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, police occupied the neighbouring favelas of
Complexo do Caju and Barreira do Vasco without trouble.</p>
