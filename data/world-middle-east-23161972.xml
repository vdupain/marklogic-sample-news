rift between the government and clergy</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Iran's
President-elect, Hassan Rouhani, has called on the government to
stop interfering in people's private lives.</p>
            <p>In a speech to clergy, Mr Rouhani said a strong government was
not one that "limits the lives of the people".</p>
            <p>He earlier called on Twitter for internet access to be freed up
and for state media to report Iran's problems.</p>
            <p>Mr Rouhani was considered politically the most moderate of the
contenders in last month's presidential election, which he won with
50.7% of the vote.</p>
            <p>He is due to be sworn in on 3 August, after the result has been
ratified by the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
            <p>Mr Rouhani, a mid-ranking cleric, told fellow clergy at a
meeting in Tehran on Monday that there "should not be any rift or
division" between them and the government, "especially at a time
when people have pinned their hopes on seeing some sort of change
in society".</p>
            <p>"We need a strong society, a strong
government. Today, the ground has been prepared for popular
participation. The people have pinned their hopes on the future,"
he said in the televised address.</p>
            <p>"A strong government does not mean a government that interferes
and intervenes in all affairs. It is not a government that limits
the lives of people. This is not a strong government."</p>
            <p>Earlier, the president-elect wrote on Twitter that the filtering
of the internet in Iran, which increased after massive opposition
protests in the wake of the disputed 2009 presidential election,
had been ineffective.</p>
            <p>"Which important piece of news has filtering been able to black
out in recent years?" he asked.</p>
            <p>Mr Rouhani also warned in his speech that the government had to
inform people about both its successes and failures.</p>
            <p>"People demand honesty and people demand honest promises from
the government," he added.</p>
            <p>He was earlier critical on Twitter of the state broadcaster,
IRIB, which has a monopoly on terrestrial television in Iran,
accusing it of ignoring major issues affecting the country.</p>
            <p>"When IRIB airs the birth of a panda in China but nothing about
unpaid workers protesting, it is obvious that the people and youth
will ignore it," he wrote.</p>
