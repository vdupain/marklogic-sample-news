            <p class="introduction">A new picture of
actor David Bradley as the first Doctor, William Hartnell, has been
released by the BBC.</p>
            <p>An Adventure in Space and Time, written by Mark Gatiss, will
tell the story of the formation of the sci-fi drama in the early
1960s.</p>
            <p>The actor, best-known for his role as caretaker Filch in the
Harry Potter films, gave a "wonderfully touching and subtle
performance" said Gatiss.</p>
            <p>The one-off drama will be shown as part of Doctor Who's 50th
anniversary.</p>
            <p>Bradley said he was "absolutely thrilled" to be offered the role
by Gatiss after starring in a 2012 episode, Dinosaurs on a
Spaceship.</p>
            <p>"When he asked if I would interested, I almost bit his hand
off!" Bradley said <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21251726">earlier
this year</a>.</p>
            <p>Scottish actor Brian Cox, will appear alongside Bradley as BBC
Head of Drama, Sydney Newman, who was credited with the creation of
the show.</p>
            <p>Doctor Who was first broadcast on 23 November 1963, with a
four-part adventure known as An Unearthly Child.</p>
            <p>Hartnell, who died in 1975, starred in the series from 1963 to
1966 before being replaced by Patrick Troughton.</p>
            <p>An Adventure in Space and Time is one of a number of programmes
that will mark Doctor Who's half-centenary later this year.</p>
