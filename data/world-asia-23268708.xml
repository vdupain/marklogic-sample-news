            <p class="introduction">Malala Yousafzai,
the Pakistani girl shot in the head by the Taliban last October,
will address a special session of the United Nations on Friday as
she marks her 16th birthday.</p>
            <p>She is expected to press world leaders to do more to deliver
education for all.</p>
            <p>Her native Pakistan has the second highest number of
out-of-school children in the world.</p>
            <p>When a Taliban gunman shot Malala Yousafzai last October, the
bullet travelled beyond her native Swat Valley in northern
Pakistan.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Malala Yousafzai has become famous for
championing education for all</span>
            </div>
            <p>It echoed around the globe, and ricocheted through another
conservative community in the north - with surprising results.</p>
            <p>First there was fear, says local aid worker, Qurratul Ain
Sheikh, sitting in a school courtyard perched on a hilltop. "After
the Malala issue so many parents, especially mothers, did not allow
their daughters to come to school," she said. "They were so
afraid."</p>
            <p>That anxiety kept the girls' primary school empty for a
month.</p>
            <p>But then aid workers, and teachers, began to fight back. They
lobbied parents about the need to educate their daughters. They
began holding meetings and putting pamphlets through doors. And the
Malala effect kicked in - parents refused to be cowed, and sent
their daughters back to school.</p>
            <p>"There was a positive change, especially
in the mothers," says Qurratul Ain. "They allow their daughters to
go to school and work like Malala, and raise their voices for their
rights, especially child rights."</p>
            <p>And there was a bonus - enrolment went up, with an extra 30
girls coming to school, swelling the numbers to almost 300.</p>
            <p>This school has not been targeted by the Taliban, nor have
others in the area. But we have decided not to identify the
location as a precaution.</p>
            <p>Behind high white-washed walls, the school day begins with
assembly in the yard. The pupils line up neatly, to sing the
national anthem, clad in white headscarves, and pale blue
tunics.</p>
            <p>Then they file into colourful classrooms, where posters of
flowers and insects line the walls. Younger pupils sit in clusters
on woven mats on the floor.</p>
            <p>A slight 10-year-old called Tasleem is one of the new arrivals.
She's polite, and chatty, and wants to be a policewoman. Tasleem
says her mother was angered by the sight of Malala being rushed
away after the attack, fighting for her life.</p>
            <p>"Before Malala was shot we didn't think we should go to school,"
she told me. "My Mum saw what happened on TV. That made her think.
After this she decided her girls should also be in school and
should get a good education. "</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Enrolment went up in this primary school in the
aftermath of Malala's shooting</span>
            </div>
            <p>Tasleem lowers her eyes when she recalls how the campaigning
teenager was shown no mercy. "She was attacked so brutally," she
says, "and she had done nothing wrong. The men who shot her
probably didn't like that she was helping girls to be educated. We
should all follow her example," she says firmly.</p>
            <p>Sitting alongside her is Nadia, a studious 10-year old who
dreams of being a doctor. Like Tasleem, she is the first girl in
her family to go to school.</p>
            <p>"I used to tell my father I want to go to school," she says. "He
always said no. But when my parents heard about Malala's story they
said you should go to school. When I started I didn't know
anything. Then my teacher explained things to me. I learnt how to
read and write, and a lot of other things."</p>
            <p>Malala has changed the equation for these girls, in this
mountain hamlet. But many children in Pakistan never see the inside
of a classroom.</p>
            <p>The country has the second highest number
of children out of school in the world, and the figures are getting
worse.</p>
            <p>Around 5.4 million children of primary school age don't get an
education, according to the latest statistics from the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco).
There are an additional seven million adolescents out of school.
And spending on education has been decreasing in recent years.</p>
            <p>Pakistan invests seven times more in the military than in
primary schooling. What these numbers add up to is a lost
generation.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Children as young as four spend long
hours shaping mud into mounds, for use in bricks</span>
            </div>
            <p>Many children in Pakistan only learn lessons in hardship. The
country has an army of child labourers born into poverty, and often
into debt. A leading Children's rights group here, SPARC, estimates
they could number as many as 12 million.</p>
            <p>At a kiln outside the city of Hyderabad, in the southern
province of Sindh, the BBC filmed some of them at work. Children as
young as four and five squat for hours, shaping mud into mounds to
be baked into bricks. They are caked in dust, and scorched by the
sun. Everyone has to pull their weight - even scrawny boys pushed
wheelbarrows around the site.</p>
            <p>Ten-year-old Jeeni toils here with the
rest of her family - nine siblings, mother and father. Like many at
the kilns, they are members of Pakistan's Hindu minority.</p>
            <p>They earn just 300 Pakistani rupees (
Ã‚Â£2; $3) a day, which isn't enough for one
decent meal. And to get that, they have to produce 1,000 bricks,
which takes up to 15 hours.</p>
            <p>Under her faded pink headscarf, Jeeni has a troubled and weary
look. Her young shoulders are carrying an adult burden and these
days it's heavier than ever.</p>
            <p>"If we earn, we eat," she says, "otherwise we go hungry. My big
brother was hurt. He can't help our father making bricks. He can't
make any money. So now it's only us - younger ones - who are
working." As she speaks, her voice breaks and she begins to
cry.</p>
            <p>Jeeni's father, Genu, who is hollow-cheeked, knows his children
are being robbed of their future, but says he is too poor to stop
it.</p>
            <p>"I understand the importance of education," he says, sitting in
the dirt. "I had some schooling myself. If I die what will happen
to them? They are illiterate. Anybody will be able to trick them.
But I can't manage to send them to school."</p>
            <p>Jeeni went to school once - for a day - but transport was
costly.</p>
            <p>She longs to return, but that dream may be buried, brick by
brick.</p>
