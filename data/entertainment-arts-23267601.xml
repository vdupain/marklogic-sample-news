            <p class="introduction">Alfred Hitchcock's
nine surviving silent films will join artefacts such as the
Domesday Book in representing the cultural heritage of the UK.</p>
            <p>Hitchcock's films - the British director's earliest works -
premiered at the British Film Institute last summer following
extensive restoration.</p>
            <p>They have now been added to the Unesco UK Memory of the World
Register.</p>
            <p>The register "reflects the richness of UK culture and history,
from medieval manuscripts to ground-breaking cinema".</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://www.unesco.org.uk/uk_memory_of_the_world_register#subs">The
online catalogue</a> which highlights documentary heritage holding
cultural significance specific to the UK, was created in July
2010.</p>
            <p>Eleven items, selected from UK libraries, archives and museums,
have been selected this year to join the current collection, which
includes The Bodleian Library's Cura Pastoralis of Gregory,
purported to be the earliest surviving book written entirely in the
English language.</p>
            <p>"We are very pleased to see that the early films from one of the
world's best known filmmakers are taking their place alongside some
of the greatest cultural artefacts of the United Kingdom," said
Robin Baker, head curator at the British Film Institute (BFI).</p>
            <p>"Film culture is too often overlooked in summaries of British
cultural heritage," he added.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>'New audiences'</strong>
            </p>
            <p>"The BFI National Archive's painstaking restorations are
attracting not only new audiences around the world but the acclaim
of the international community as important works of world cultural
note," said Mr Baker.</p>
            <p>The British Film Institute (BFI) spent three years restoring
nine silent Hitchcock films, made between 1925 and 1929, ahead of
their premiere at the London 2012 Festival last year.</p>
            <p>Titles include debut feature The Pleasure Garden and boxing
drama The Ring. A tenth film made during the period, The Mountain
Eagle (1926), remains lost.</p>
            <p>The Hitchcock 9, cited as a blueprint for the director's best
known post-war films such as Psycho and Vertigo, are currently
being screened across the US.</p>
            <p>Last year, Hitchcock's Vertigo replaced Orson Welles's Citizen
Kane at the top of the British Film Institute's Sight and Sound
magazine poll as the greatest film of all time.</p>
