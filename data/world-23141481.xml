            <p class="introduction">A film banned as
pornography in China was accidentally shown on a large LED screen
in a public square in Jilin province, Chinese media report.</p>
            <p>Xin Jin Ping Mei (known in English as The Forbidden Legend: Sex
and Chopsticks) was reportedly played to a surprised public for
about 10 minutes.</p>
            <p>A technician had been watching the film on his computer without
realising it was connected to the LED screen.</p>
            <p>He was meant to have been repairing the screen, reports
said.</p>
            <p>The advertising company that owned the screen alerted the
technician, identified as Yuan Mou, to the live broadcast.</p>
            <p>Mr Yuan then unplugged his computer and threw the disc out of
the window, according to Chinese media reports.</p>
            <p>However, news of the accidental broadcast quickly spread, and
photos of the film playing over the main square near Jilin railway
station went viral online.</p>
            <p>The incident is said to have taken place last week and reports
said that police are investigating.</p>
            <p>Chinese microblog users primarily reacted to the incident with
amusement.</p>
            <p>Microblogger Exclusive Title described Xin Jin Ping Mei as a
"class A Hong Kong film", while user Oriental Emperor wrote: "It's
not broadcasting a sex tape of one of our officials, what's the big
fuss?", referring to the recent scandal of a former Chongqing
official.</p>
            <p>The film Xin Jin Ping Mei is based on the 17th Century Chinese
novel, known as The Plum in the Golden Vase.</p>
            <p>The version broadcast is widely reported to be a Hong Kong
remake of the film, with the English name: The Forbidden Legend:
Sex and Chopsticks.</p>
            <p>China has tight regulations controlling which films can be
broadcast, including politically sensitive films and some
pornographic films.</p>
