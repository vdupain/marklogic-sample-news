            <p class="introduction">The Queen has
officially reopened the former home of author Sir Walter Scott in
the Scottish Borders after its multi-million pound restoration.</p>
            <p>Abbotsford House, near Melrose, will open to the public on
Thursday.</p>
            <p>The royal visitor was given a tour of the house, which shut for
major renovations nearly two years ago.</p>
            <p>The Abbotsford Trust hopes the historic building can become both
an "important cultural centre and tourist destination" for the
region.</p>
            <p>The reopening brought to an end months of construction work and
meticulous preparation.</p>

            <p>A new visitor centre has been constructed
and thousands of items removed and then returned.</p>
            <p>During her tour of the building, The Queen was introduced to
guests including trustees and employees of the Abbotsford Trust and
a number of Sir Walter Scott's descendants from the UK and
overseas.</p>
            <p>She also unveiled a plaque to commemorate the occasion.</p>
            <p>The chief executive of the Abbotsford Trust, Jason Dyer, said
the Queen was knowledgeable about Scott's life and works and
remembered the house well from two previous visits.</p>
            <p>Commenting on the reopening, he said:
"This has been the culmination of over seven years of work and
planning so it is quite incredible that this day has finally
come.</p>
            <p>"The Queen's visit is testament to the standing of Sir Walter
Scott, his reputation, what he did for Scotland, the UK, and what
he did for literature globally.</p>
            <p>"I think sometimes we forget here the massive impact that he had
on the world."</p>
            <p>In a letter to Abbotsford Trust chairman, Lord Sanderson, Prime
Minister David Cameron described the restoration as a "tremendous
achievement".</p>
            <p>"I can only imagine the number of dedicated people involved with
a project on this scale, but everyone - no matter what their role -
should be justifiably proud of what has been achieved," he
said.</p>
            <p>"It is vitally important to make the most of our built and
cultural heritage in this way, to enrich the life of the local
community, and also to offer visitors from near and far a taste of
our nation's rich history.</p>
            <p>"Abbotsford, Sir Walter Scott's great architectural marvel, is a
true icon of its time.</p>
            <p>"It can now stand for many years to come as a tribute to Scott's
creative ingenuity."</p>
            <p>He said he had no doubt it would "welcome
and inspire future generations of great British writers and poets
among its many visitors".</p>
            <p>Scott was born in Edinburgh in 1771 but lived in the Borders for
much of his life.</p>
            <p>His most famous works include Waverley, Rob Roy and Ivanhoe and
he is seen as a key figure in the development of the modern
historical novel.</p>
            <p>He purchased the farm and farmhouse, then known as Cartleyhole,
in 1811.</p>
            <p>He changed the name to Abbotsford to commemorate the monks of
Melrose, who had owned the land and used the nearby river
crossing.</p>
            <p>Work continued on the building following Scott's death in 1832
and it remained in his family until relatively recently.</p>
            <p>The Abbotsford Trust was formed in 2007 following the death of
Dame Jean Maxwell-Scott, the last of his descendants to live in the
house.</p>
            <p>It launched a campaign to raise Ã‚Â£10m in
order to preserve, protect and improve the site "for the benefit
and enjoyment of the public".</p>
            <p>That was boosted in late 2009 when Scottish Borders Council
agreed a Ã‚Â£1.5m support package for the
scheme.</p>
            <p>Then, in the summer of 2010, the Heritage Lottery Fund announced
it would award nearly Ã‚Â£5m to the
project.</p>
            <p>Abbotsford House was not the only literary stopping point during
the Queen's time in the Scottish Borders.</p>
            <p>She visited the John Buchan Museum in Peebles before carrying
out the official opening later in the day.</p>
