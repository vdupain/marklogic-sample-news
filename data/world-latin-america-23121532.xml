            <p class="introduction">Protesters in Brazil
have clashed with police during the Confederations Cup final
between the host nation and Spain in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
            <p>Riot police fired tear gas as demonstrators threw missiles near
the Maracana football stadium.</p>
            <p>President Dilma Rousseff did not attend the match. She was booed
at the opening of the tournament.</p>
            <p>The protests started nearly a month ago, sparked by transport
fare rises, but quickly encompassed other issues.</p>
            <p>The main grievances are over the costs of staging the World Cup,
corruption and demands for better health, education and
transport.</p>
            <p>Earlier on Sunday a group of demonstrators tried to storm a
Brazilian Football Association (CBF) building in Rio. But police
kept them back and the group settled outside the building.</p>
            <p>The protesters demanded the resignation of CBF president Jose
Maria Marin, who has been accused of incompetence.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Despite the huge security operation,
thousands marched towards the stadium</span>
            </div>
            <p>In a separate protest, several thousand people marched on
Maracana stadium banging drums.</p>
            <p>They demanded free public transport, carrying placards reading
"Fifa - you pay the bill". The demonstrators also called for and
end to corruption and the resignation of the Rio State
governor.</p>
            <p>Minutes before the game began, small groups of protesters threw
rocks and firecrackers at police lines.</p>
            <p>Security forces responded with tear gas and sent armoured
vehicles to disperse the demonstrators. There were no further
incidents during the game - which saw Brazil beat Spain 3-0.</p>
            <p>The wave of protests began nearly a month ago in the city Sao
Paulo after bus fares were increased by 10%.</p>
            <p>But after heavy-handed police action, it spread to other cities
and mobilised public opinion.</p>
            <p>The rises in Sao Paulo and many other Brazilian cities were
revoked after two weeks of protests.</p>
            <p>By then, the demonstrations had turned into a nationwide
movement for better education, healthcare and transport.</p>
