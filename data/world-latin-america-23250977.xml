            <p class="introduction">An Italian judge has
ordered 49 suspected Latin American gang members to stand trial for
allegedly using dogs to smuggle cocaine into the country.</p>
            <p>A vet in Mexico forced large dogs to swallow drug packages
before they were flown into Milan, police say.</p>
            <p>On arrival, they were killed and dismembered to retrieve the
cocaine in a case which has outraged animal rights activists.</p>
            <p>The Ecuadorean, Peruvian and Salvadoran nationals will face
trial in Italy.</p>
            <p>The suspected gang members, between 19 and 37 years old, are
thought to be part of youth drug gangs known as "pandillas".</p>
            <p>The gangs go under the names Trebol, Neta, Latin King Luzbel and
Latin King Chicago, according to the investigative judge Fabrizio
D'Arcangelo.</p>
            <p>Mr D'Arcangelo told reporters the armed gangs were involved in
several crimes in and around Milan.</p>
            <p>The drug trafficking operation was first uncovered in March,
when 75 suspects were arrested.</p>
            <p>Animal rights organisations have reacted angrily at the
trafficking scheme.</p>
            <p>They say many of the dogs must have died before arriving in
Italy, as a small leak of cocaine would have been enough to kill
them.</p>
            <p>The 49 Latin Americans will stand trial for organised crime and
court proceedings have been set for 9 October.</p>
