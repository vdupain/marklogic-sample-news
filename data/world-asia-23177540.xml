            <p class="introduction">Japan has warned
that China is engaging in "dangerous actions" and attempting to
change the status quo in the East China Sea "by force".</p>
            <p>The comments were made in Japan's annual defence white paper -
the first since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office late last
year.</p>
            <p>Both China and Japan have stepped up maritime patrols around
disputed islands in the region in recent months.</p>
            <p>The paper also expressed concern over North Korea's missiles
programme.</p>
            <p>Maritime tensions between Japan and China increased last year
after Japan nationalised three islands in a disputed grouping known
as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.</p>
            <p>Japan has control of the islands and bought three of them from
their private Japanese owner in 2012.</p>
            <p>Since then, China has sent government ships to patrol in what
Japan says are its territorial waters, leading to fears of a
clash.</p>
            <p>"China has attempted to change the status quo by force based on
its own assertion, which is incompatible with the existing order of
international law," the white paper said.</p>
            <p>"Some of China's activities involve its intrusion into Japan's
territorial waters, its violation of Japan's territorial airspace
and even dangerous actions that could cause a contingency," the
paper added.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, Japan said a Chinese naval frigate had locked
fire-control radar onto a Japanese ship near the disputed islands -
claims China denied.</p>
            <p>Japan earlier this month also expressed serious concern over
China's construction of a drilling rig near a disputed gas field in
the East China Sea.</p>
            <p>Mr Abe, who is viewed as a conservative, plans to update Japan's
defence policy over the coming year.</p>
            <p>He is also pushing for Japan's pacifist constitution to be
revised in order to ease tight restrictions on the armed
forces.</p>
            <p>In January, Japan increased its military spending for the first
time in over a decade.</p>
            <p>The paper also said that North Korea's ballistic missile
programme had "entered a new phase".</p>
            <p>"In conjunction with its efforts to enhance its ballistic
missile capability, the nuclear tests by North Korea pose a
significant threat to Japan's security," the report said.</p>
