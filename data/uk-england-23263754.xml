            <p class="introduction">The military funeral
of Fusilier Lee Rigby will take place later at Bury Parish Church
in Greater Manchester.</p>
            <p>Fusilier Rigby's body was guarded overnight during a vigil at
the church by members of his regiment, the Royal Regiment of
Fusiliers.</p>
            <p>The 25-year-old soldier, from Middleton, was killed in Woolwich,
south-east London, in May.</p>
            <p>His family has thanked people "across the world" for their
"overwhelming support".</p>
            <p>Fusilier Rigby's wife Rebecca said: "There are so many kind and
generous people out there.</p>
            <p>"It's just horrible that it takes something such as this to make
you see how many good people there are."</p>
            <p>Asked about how Fusilier Rigby would like to be remembered, Mrs
Rigby said: "Lee always wanted his service to be a time that people
would remember him and shed the tears, but then he always said a
remembrance of his life.</p>
            <p>"He wanted people to enjoy that and sit and talk about happy
days and happy memories they have got of Lee and the things he used
to do and say because he was always so full of life."</p>

            <p>Fusilier Rigby's stepfather Ian Rigby said: "I think today
should be a celebration of Lee's life, what he has meant to us.</p>
            <p>"Lee was a fun-loving lad and that is how he should be
remembered."</p>
            <p>The service will start at about 11:00 BST and will be relayed
outside.</p>
            <p>At the same time the regular morning summer train service
between Fort William and Mallaig, hauled by the steam loco 45407
The Lancashire Fusilier will pause for two minutes on the
Glenfinnan Viaduct as a mark for respect.</p>
            <p>The engine is owned and run by Ian Riley, whose engineering
works are on the East Lancs Railway in Bury</p>
            <p>The leader of Rochdale Council Colin Lambert praised local
people for the way they has supported the Rigby family.</p>
            <p>"We say to everyone keep Lee in your mind, in your thoughts and
the thoughts of the family and let's give Lee an honourable send
off, he said."</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://www.bury.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=8512">Police and
councils have designated "suitable roads"</a> for members of the
public to line once the body leaves the church ahead of a private
burial at Middleton Cemetery.</p>
            <p>Michael Adebolajo, 28, from Romford, east London, and Michael
Adebowale, 22, from Greenwich, south-east London, are accused of
Fusilier Rigby's murder.</p>
            <p>Mr Adebolajo is also accused of the attempted murder of two
police officers and possession of a firearm with intent to cause
others to believe that violence would be used.</p>
