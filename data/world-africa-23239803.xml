            <p class="introduction">In Kenya, prisoners
are taking the law into their own hands and using it to get out of
jail.</p>
            <p>"Last week Abdi's sentence was reduced from death to seven
years. We also helped another inmate win his appeal, and he has
already left," says Douglas Owiyo, one of a team of prisoner
paralegals at Shimo La Tewa maximum security prison in Mombasa.</p>
            <p>Since 2007, when he and a dozen other inmates were trained in
the law, they have launched more than 3,000 successful appeals,
even though they are not fully qualified lawyers</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Abdi Moka (L) says he owes the
paralegals, like Douglas Owiyo (R), his life</span>
            </div>
            <p>In Kenya, the majority of people accused of committing a crime
face court without a lawyer.</p>
            <p>Abdi Moka was one of these.</p>
            <p>When he found himself before a judge facing a charge of robbery
with violence, he had no idea what to plead or how to defend
himself.</p>
            <p>Robbery with violence carries a mandatory death sentence in
Kenya, and before he knew what was happening, Moka was on death
row.</p>
            <p>Owiyo and the other prisoner paralegals drafted a written
submission which Moka presented at his appeal. They won.</p>
            <p>The appeal judge agreed that Moka should have been charged with
a lesser crime and given a much lighter sentence.</p>
            <p>"When I was sentenced to death I thought I would lose my mind,"
Moka remembers.</p>
            <p>"But now, thanks to the paralegals, I have hope again."</p>
            <p>Mombasa's chief magistrate, Stephen
Riech, admits that the lack of legal representation for defendants
leads to injustice.</p>
            <p>"There is a lot of it because, for instance, if someone is
charged with being in possession of a weapon with intent to steal,
he may say: 'Yes, I was found in possession of a weapon,' and admit
[that].</p>
            <p>"But the catch is he had no intention of stealing. If he knew
some basics he could not have done that."</p>
            <p>He says the impact of the prisoner paralegals can really be seen
when defendants come to court.</p>
            <p>"Once they have exposure to the paralegals they know their
rights," he says.</p>
            <p>"They ask for the statements of the witnesses, they sometimes
ask for adjournments so they can prepare their defence.</p>
            <p>"I can see them asking intelligent questions to the witnesses
who are testifying against them.</p>
            <p>"Some even make submissions on points of law, which to my mind
is a great improvement."</p>
            <p>The organisation responsible for the training of prisoner
paralegals in Kenya is Kituo Cha Sheria.</p>
            <p>Set up in 1973 by a group of Kenyan lawyers concerned by the
lack of legal help available to the poor, Kituo Cha Sheria has now
evolved into a multi-faceted legal aid and advocacy group.</p>
            <p>It campaigns on issues such as abolishing the death penalty,
which is still in place in Kenya, although no-one has been executed
since 1987.</p>
            <p>Following the success of the original prisoner paralegal
training in Mombasa, Kituo Cha Sheria has now trained teams in
Kamiti Maximum Security Prison and Langata Women's Prison in the
capital, Nairobi.</p>
            <p>Lifer Joseph Karanja, who heads the paralegals at Kamiti, says
that in the first nine months since the training, his team won 120
appeals.</p>
            <p>This is confirmed by prison officer Senior Sergeant Benson Ngui,
who adds that, prior to the training, he would have expected no
more than one or two successful appeals in a year.</p>
            <p>So how do the prisoner paralegals manage
to win so many appeals?</p>
            <p>They told me they used the failings of the system, exposing
shoddy investigations by the police and incompetent rulings by
magistrates.</p>
            <p>"We try to prove the trial wasn't safe, for instance in a case
of defilement [child sexual abuse], the victim was never examined
by a doctor, and the only evidence was the testimony of the mother
who may have a grudge against the accused," said Denga John Lenda,
the deputy head of the paralegal team at Kamiti.</p>
            <p>"We don't mind if you committed it or not, we are trying to
argue with the evidence the court adduced."</p>
            <p>Karanja is also proud to report that even those prisoners who do
have lawyers are choosing to dismiss them and rely on fellow
inmates instead.</p>
            <p>Kenya's constitution says that citizens have the right to a
state-funded lawyer "if substantial injustice would otherwise
result".</p>
            <p>Allan Nyange, who works as an advocate for Kituo Cha Sheria,
explains that even when these state lawyers are provided, they can
sometimes be more of a hindrance than a help.</p>
            <p>"This is a file that is forced on an
advocate, so you can imagine [they are] not interested in criminal
things, [they] have other better, well-paid briefs, and this is a
matter that is wasting [their] time," he explains.</p>
            <p>"So in most cases, most lawyers who are given those cases do not
bother, and they would look for any opportunity to ask for an
adjournment."</p>
            <p>For Mr Nyange, there is in no doubt about the effectiveness of
the prisoner paralegals.</p>
            <p>"I'll tell you for a fact that most of them are better than
lawyers, trained lawyers," he says.</p>
            <p>"They have all the time, and they are motivated by the fact that
that is how you get people off the system and that is how you might
be able to go home."</p>
            <p>But what happens when these paralegals do get out of prison?</p>
            <p>Dismas Omondi was one of the first batch of paralegals to be
trained in Mombasa back in 2007.</p>
            <p>After more than 13 years on death row, he finally won his appeal
and was released in 2010.</p>
            <p>He is personally credited with helping more than 250 fellow
inmates get acquitted.</p>
            <p>Since his release, he has been working at Mombasa's High Court -
but not in a way that puts his legal knowledge and experience to
good use.</p>
            <p>He cleans the public toilets.</p>
            <p>Mr Omondi needs to earn a living, and, at present, paralegals
like him are expressly forbidden from charging for their
advice.</p>
            <p>Kenyan lawyers have expressed concern
that paralegals could start passing themselves off as fully fledged
lawyers to unsuspecting members of the public, and this is supposed
to deter them.</p>
            <p>But the prisoner paralegals have an ally in Kenya's Chief
Justice Willy Mutunga.</p>
            <p>A reformer and human rights activist, he was one of the founders
of Kituo Cha Sheria.</p>
            <p>"From what I've seen of those paralegals in those prisons, it's
a calling - I've no doubt in my mind they can do a good job," he
says.</p>
            <p>"If you are talking about justice, and somebody comes to my
court and says: 'I don't have a lawyer but I have this paralegal
and he's going to represent me', it should be the just thing to
do.</p>
            <p>"We've got to find ways of getting these paralegals into our
courts.</p>
            <p>"The law society should see these guys as reinforcement.</p>
            <p>"The paralegals in prisons and outside prisons must play a role
in the administration of justice."</p>

               <strong>One of the first prisoners to be trained as a paralegal,
Dismas Omondi headed the team at Shimo La Tewa and is personally
credited with securing the freedom of 250 inmates until his release
after 13 years inside. Now he cleans toilets at Mombasa's High
Court:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>I was arrested and accused of robbery with violence which
carries a death sentence. I was found guilty and [for] around nine
years was in a segregation block. It was very challenging. Us
Christians were reading [the] Bible, singing hymns and
concentrating on our court files. I had books given to me by a
missionary containing the laws and past judgements. The officer in
charge allowed me access to them because he knew I was helping
others. I can perform well, more than other lawyers, because I've
been doing them practically and people have been acquitted.</p>
            <p>The government should consider supporting those who come out of
prison - the majority after serving long sentences do reform but
cannot manage outside. Like me, when I was released I was given 200
shillings ($2.30; Ã‚Â£1.50) which is not
enough to take me from Shimo to [my home in] Likoni. A chief
magistrate decided to give us [janitor jobs] at this [toilet]
facility to assist us for the time being. [People pay] 10 shillings
for both short and long calls. We get around 600 shillings a day -
shared with my colleague, an ex-prisoner. I could not have imagined
this, when in prison I could not even think of washing the
toilets.</p>
            <p>I'd like to pursue further studies, because I have enough basic
skills and knowledge regarding the law. In the court where I work I
go and read the judgementsÃ¢Â€Â¦
[often of those] I helped. I am very much happy when I meet them in
the street, they say: 'Ah Dismas, thank you!'</p>
