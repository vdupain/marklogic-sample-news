            <p class="introduction">Mexican election
officials have sparked confusion by announcing the result of a key
local election, and later saying that their count was
unreliable.</p>
            <p>Both the opposition and the governing party had claimed victory
in Sunday's vote in Baja California state.</p>
            <p>The opposition, initially declared the winner, has threatened to
withdraw co-operation with the federal government on a reform
package agreed last year.</p>
            <p>Officials have ordered a recount, to be finalised by the
weekend.</p>
            <p>Mexicans in 14 states out of 31 federal entities voted for
regional assemblies and municipal governments, but the only
governorship up for grabs was in Baja California.</p>
            <p>The opposition National Action Party (PAN) took control of Baja
California in 1989, and it has remained one of their most important
power bases.</p>
            <p>Electoral officials announced on Monday that 97% of the votes in
Baja California had been counted, and that the PAN candidate was
three percentage points ahead of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI) candidate.</p>
            <p>However, electoral council spokeswoman Helga Casanova said
errors in the count meant the result "should not be considered
reliable".</p>
            <p>A recount would begin on Wednesday and will last until the
weekend, she said.</p>
            <p>PAN officials have suggested they could pull out of the
so-called Pact for Mexico if the election issues are not sorted
out.</p>
            <p>The pact was signed last December, and contains agreements by
the three main parties to work together on the main economic and
security reforms.</p>
            <p>The plan has become the centrepiece of President Enrique Pena
Nieto's administration.</p>
            <p>He urged all parties to abide by the result and said the
elections underlined "the strength and validity of [Mexico's]
democracy, but also makes clear there are areas of opportunity to
perfect the system".</p>
            <p>The run-up to the elections was plagued by violence, with
several candidates murdered and others pulling out for fear of
being targeted.</p>
            <p>The aftermath has seen widespread confusion, with rival parties
accusing each other of dirty tricks throughout the country.</p>
