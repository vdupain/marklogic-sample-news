            <p class="introduction">A Syrian Roman
Catholic priest was killed in northern Syria last month, the
Vatican has confirmed.</p>
            <p>A statement said the circumstances of Father Francois Murad's
death were "not fully understood", but that it happened on 23 June
in the convent of the Custody of the Holy Land in Ghassaniya.</p>
            <p>The Franciscan took refuge there after the monastery of St Simon
was bombed.</p>
            <p>Some initial reports said Fr Murad was beheaded by jihadist
militants, but activists now say that he was shot.</p>
            <p>The beheading claims were based on a video posted online at
around the same time that appears to show two prisoners being
executed by rebels.</p>
            <p>The video's title referred to the killing of a priest and a
bishop, but none of the victims can be identified and none of those
featured in the video refer to such an event.</p>
            <p>After analysing the footage, local activists and Human Rights
Watch said it was most likely filmed in a different location
several months before Fr Murad was killed.</p>
            <p>Instead, he "died when he was shot inside his church" in
Ghassaniya, three separate local sources <a href="(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10153954/Priest-beheaded-in-Syria-video-actually-shot-dead.html">
told the Daily Telegraph newspaper</a>.</p>
            <p>The Custody of the Holy Land, a Franciscan order which is the
official custodian of religious sites in the Middle East, had also
issued a statement two days after Fr Murad's death saying Islamists
shot him.</p>
            <p>"Islamists attacked the monastery, ransacking it and destroying
everything," it said. "When Father Francois tried to resist,
defending the nuns, rebels shot him."</p>
