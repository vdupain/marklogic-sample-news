            <p class="introduction">China is well known
for its pirated DVDs and fake iPhones, but this "copycat culture"
extends to architecture too - with whole towns sometimes
replicated.</p>
            <p>As you enter Thames Town, the honking and chaos of Chinese city
life fall away.</p>
            <p>There are no more street vendors selling steamed pork buns, and
no more men hauling recyclables on tricycles.</p>
            <p>The road starts to wind, and then, in the distance, you see what
looks like a clock tower from a Cotswold village.</p>
            <p>"It has this almost dreamlike quality of something European,"
says Tony Mackay, a British architect, and the master planner for
the Thames Town housing scheme and the surrounding district of
Songjiang.</p>
            <p>When local officials hired Mackay in 2001, he found farms and
ducks here.</p>
            <p>Today, there are cobbled streets, pubs and half-timbered Tudor
houses.</p>
            <p>There's even a statue of Winston Churchill, and a medieval
meeting hall that advertises chicken wings and beer in Chinese
characters.</p>
            <p>But Mackay is not happy. "It doesn't look quite right," he says.
"It looks false."</p>

pictures of Thames Town</a>
            </p>
            <p>Mackay says the architects who took on the designs for the
buildings created a pastiche, throwing together different styles,
and abandoning authenticity.</p>
            <p>Some of the half-timbered houses are six storeys high, for
example, and the windows on the church just don't look right, he
says.</p>
            <p>"The proportions are wrong. The use of the different stones is
all wrong. It would never be used like that in the genuine English
church," he says.</p>
            <p>The houses in Thames Town were largely bought as investment
properties, so the town has always been quiet. It is only just
beginning to develop a real sense of life and community.</p>
            <p>To Mackay, the place looks like a film set. In fact, one Western
blogger said it reminded him of the film, The Truman Show.</p>

            <p>But Fan Yu Zhe couldn't care less.</p>
            <p>I found Fan and his bride Sun Qi Yao looking deeply into each
other's eyes as a photo assistant showered them with flower
petals.</p>
            <p>Thames Town is crawling with young couples who want to have
their wedding photos taken here.</p>
            <p>"I love European football, so I'm very interested in things from
Europe," says Fan.</p>
            <p>"I really hope I can visit the real
Thames River one day, sit along the banks, drink a cup of coffee
and enjoy the British sunshine."</p>
            <p>Nearby, a woman named Zhang Li snacks on tangerines and plays
cards with her mother and aunt.</p>
            <p>Zhang says she has come here on her day off because Chinese
towns are so crowded and commercial, but here it's green and
pleasant. And as an office administrator, she can't afford to
travel to England.</p>
            <p>"Usually if you want to see foreign buildings, you have to go
abroad," says Zhang. "But if we import them to China, people can
save money while experiencing foreign-style architecture."</p>
            <p>There's plenty of that in China.</p>
            <p>Thames Town was built as part of Shanghai's "One City, Nine
Towns" scheme, which saw a cluster of satellite towns built around
the city, each in a different international style.</p>
            <p>Elsewhere in China, there is a replica Eiffel Tower, a mock
Tower Bridge - even a recreation of Stonehenge.</p>
            <p>And last year, a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18327751">replica of the
entire Austrian alpine village of Hallstatt</a> sprung up in the
province of Guangdong. The original is a Unesco World Heritage
site.</p>

            <p>These are all examples of China's craze
for what Bianca Bosker, author of Original Copies: Architectural
Mimicry in Contemporary China, calls "duplitecture".</p>
            <p>Of course, it's not just the Chinese who love to copy. A century
and a half ago, the rapidly progressing <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2007/08/26/a_nation_of_outlaws/?page=full">
United States was a hub of counterfeiting and copying</a> and it
too has a host of more recent architectural replicas, including
country pavilions in Epcot in Florida, and plenty of examples in
Las Vegas.</p>
            <p>But according to Bosker, while many Westerners think of
knock-off architecture as kitsch and bizarre, many in China find it
truly lovely.</p>
            <p>Almost every major city in China has a
residential suburb where people live in replica mansions, and as
many as two-thirds of the properties for sale with some estate
agents are Western-style, she says.</p>
            <p>Bosker says that's partly because China has a different attitude
towards copying.</p>
            <p>"The culture of copy in China is very different from what we
find in the West, where there's a sense that copying is something
incredibly taboo, and to be avoided at all costs."</p>
            <p>In China, she says, mimicry is seen as "a form of mastery", and
is therefore not frowned upon - but encouraged.</p>
            <p>This culture of copying has deep historical roots. As <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19922863">China's first
emperor, Qin Shi Huang</a> - of terracotta army fame - conquered
rival kingdoms in the 3rd Century BC, he built a replica of each of
their palaces within his own capital city.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to today and the Chinese government often bankrolls
major copycat projects.</p>
            <p>It's a way of flexing its muscles, says Bosker. "China is, in a
very symbolic way, showing off its ability to rearrange the cosmos,
to sort of own the greatest hits of the West."</p>
            <p>It's no accident, says Bosker, that the White House - the
ultimate symbol of US power - is one of the most copied buildings
in China.</p>
            <p>But not all Chinese people are supportive of this copycat
architecture.</p>
            <p>"I don't like them at all," says Tong Ming, a Shanghai-based
architect.</p>
            <p>China has its own rich architectural heritage, says Tong, like
the <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/813">Classical Gardens
of Suzhou</a>, the <a href="http://www.dpm.org.cn/shtml/2/@/8797.html">Forbidden City</a> in
Beijing, and the country's traditional wooden buildings.</p>
            <div class="caption full-width">

               <span style="width:624px;">The Classical Gardens of Suzhou are a Unesco World
Heritage site</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chinese people do value this history, he says, but, at a time of
such rapid change, people find it more practical - and even
comforting - to copy Western styles.</p>
            <p>"I think it is quite a specific period of time - people cannot
get accustomed to changing times.</p>
            <p>"So it's quite understandable that they would follow something
that they admire, or are familiar with from the mass media," says
Tong.</p>
            <p>"People want something with a quite clear identity. They
couldn't find exactly what next, so they turn to something they are
familiar with."</p>
            <p>Tong thinks, in time, Chinese
architecture will find its own path once again.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, some new housing developments are creating
Western-style architecture "with a Chinese skin", says Bosker -
incorporating a Chinese garden layout, for example, or feng shui
principles.</p>
            <p>British architect Tony Mackay thinks China's imitation towns are
a fad - a by-product of China's desire to connect with the world
after decades of relative isolation - but he sees a new trend
emerging.</p>
            <p>"The younger generations here they don't want old-fashioned
style, they want modernism. They want something new, which connects
to their gear, their iPads, and their modern lifestyle," he
says.</p>
            <p>One example is the sleek, ultra-modern, prestige <a href="http://www.zaha-hadid.com/architecture/wangjing-soho/">Wangjing
SOHO project</a> in Beijing, by British-Iraqi architect Zaha
Hadid.</p>

            <p>When it's finished, it will resemble three fish-like forms
emerging from a stream.</p>
            <p>There's just one problem. A suspiciously similar structure is
being built in the city of Chongqing.</p>
            <p>According to one industry publication, the alleged copy may be
finished before the original.</p>

            <p>"China is the world centre for counterfeiting. Whatever can make
a quick buck - mobile phones, pirated DVDs, fake watches,
jewellery, branded clothing and so on.</p>
            <p>"There is a very different starting point. In China, to copy
something is to show deep respect. Traditional society in China is
very hierarchical. You have the masters of their art, and a lot of
artists saw copying one of the masters - as exactly as possible -
as being the highest thing they could do, because the master was
the great genius.</p>
            <p>"The idea of the work the artist creates being an extension of
his individual personality - and therefore that to take that is not
only unimaginative, but in some way immoral - is very much a
typically Western idea. The idea of it being cheating in that sense
doesn't have much depth in China.</p>
            <p>"I'm not saying they are innocent, but there is this cultural
attitude, that copying is a sign of respect."</p>
