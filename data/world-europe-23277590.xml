            <p class="introduction">Lawmakers in the
Republic of Ireland have voted to legalise abortion under certain
conditions for the first time.</p>
            <p>The move - approved by a 127-31 vote in the
DÃƒÂ¡il - would authorise a termination when
doctors deem that a woman is at risk of taking her life. It needs
upper house endorsement, too.</p>
            <p>The vote follows the case of an Indian woman who died in
hospital after she was refused an abortion.</p>
            <p>The debate revealed deep splits in the predominantly Roman
Catholic country.</p>
            <p>Opponents say the bill could lead to more widespread
abortion.</p>

when doctors deems that a woman is at risk of taking her own
life</p>
            </div>
            <p>Anti-abortion campaigners say that the bill will allow the
intentional killing of the unborn for the first time in the
Republic of Ireland.</p>
            <p>For them, it is not just a religious but a human rights issue as
they believe that in any pregnancy the mother and foetus have equal
rights to life.</p>
            <p>Others argue the bill is too limited as it does not allow for
terminations in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal
abnormality.</p>
            <p>Nor does it allow for termination when the foetus cannot survive
outside the womb.</p>
            <p>Members of parliament (TDs) backed the proposal shortly after
midnight on Friday - after two hotly debated sessions.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Anti-abortion activists want the law to
remain unchanged</span>
            </div>
            <p>Still, those who support access to abortion say the bill ignores
the fact that, on average, 11 women leave the country every day for
an abortion in Britain.</p>
            <p>Since a Supreme Court ruling in 1992, known as the X case,
abortion has been constitutionally available when a woman's life,
as distinct from her health, is at risk from the continued
pregnancy.</p>
            <p>X was a suicidal 14-year-old schoolgirl who had been raped by a
neighbour and was initially prevented from leaving the country for
an abortion in Britain.</p>
            <p>Since then, the credible threat of suicide is, constitutionally,
regarded as grounds for a termination.</p>
            <p>But in the intervening years, until now, no government has
introduced legislation to give doctors legal certainty on when an
abortion can be carried out.</p>
            <p>And that uncertainty provided part of the context for the Savita
Halappanavar case.</p>
            <p>She was a 31-year-old Indian dentist who was admitted to
hospital in Galway in October 2012 while miscarrying.</p>
            <div class="caption body-narrow-width">

               <span style="width:304px;">The death of Savita Halappanavar drew attention to
the lack of clarity about the legal position</span>
            </div>
            <p>She died a week later from septicaemia.</p>
            <p>Her request for an abortion was turned down.</p>
            <p>Her inquest heard that she could not get a termination at the
time because her life was not in danger but, by the time her life
was at risk, an abortion would have been too late to save her.</p>
            <p>The Fine Gael-Labour coalition government says its proposed
legislation will bring the law and constitution into line.</p>
            <p>There have been consequences for TDs who did not support the
changes proposed.</p>
            <p>Fine Gael Junior Minister of State for European Affairs, Lucinda
Creighton, voted against the government on the amendment. As a
result, she was automatically expelled from the party.</p>
            <p>She said she felt "deeply and strongly" that aspects of the bill
were based on "flawed logic and absolutely zero medical
evidence".</p>
            <p>Last week, four other Fine Gael TDs, were removed from the party
after they voted against the bill's first reading in the
DÃƒÂ¡il.</p>
            <p>Sinn FÃƒÂ©in TD Peadar
ToibÃƒÂ­n also chose to vote against the
amendment, which was supported by his party.</p>
            <p>In a statement, Sinn FÃƒÂ©in said all of its
TDs had been "mandated" to vote for the legislation.</p>
            <p>"The decision this evening by Peadar
ToibÃƒÂ­n TD to vote against the Sinn
FÃƒÂ©in position is a serious breach of party
rules," said Sinn FÃƒÂ©in's party whip in the
DÃƒÂ¡il, Aengus ÃƒÂ“
Snodaigh.</p>
            <p>"As a consequence Peadar ToibÃƒÂ­n has been
suspended from Sinn FÃƒÂ©in for six months with
immediate effect."</p>
