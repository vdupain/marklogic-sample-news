            <p class="introduction">Earthquakes can be
triggered at the sites of wastewater injection by quakes on the
other side of the world, research suggests.</p>
            <p>The injection of wastewater from underground operations such as
oil drilling is known to increase local seismic activity.</p>
            <p>Now a study in Science suggests that waves from the most distant
temblors can cause quakes at wastewater sites.</p>
            <p>Researchers suggest this can act as a kind of "stress meter" for
the sites.</p>
            <p>The notion of natural earthquake triggering is not new; in
hydrothermal and volcanic areas, tremors can be triggered by large,
distant earthquakes. But the new study suggests what is in effect a
new category: natural triggering of seismic events primed by human
activity.</p>
            <p>Injection of wastewater from operations such as drilling,
geothermal, or hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") is banned in the
UK and many European countries, but it has become increasingly
prevalent in the US.</p>
            <p>In the state of Texas alone, <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/series/water-for-fracking/map/">more
than 7,000 such wells are in operation</a> and the link between
injection wells and even large seismic events is strengthening.</p>
            <p>In March, researchers <a href="/news/science-environment-21952428"
               title="US quake linked to oil wastewater">linked a 5.7-magnitude event in
Oklahoma to waste water injection</a> that had been going on for
nearly two decades.</p>
            <p>"In some cases of induced earthquakes you drill a well, you
start pumping, and a week or two later you start having earthquakes
on a very nearby fault - we saw this in Arkansas in 2011, and a
site in Ohio," explained lead author of the study Nicholas van der
Elst of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia
University, New York.</p>
            <p>The team scoured the seismic records for three wastewater
injection sites in the US states of Oklahoma, Colorado and Texas,
looking for signs of the smallest earthquakes that could be
detected.</p>
            <p>"In the sites we looked at, the connection hadn't been quite as
straightforward, so we were looking for additional evidence that
fluids were bringing these regions to the tipping point," Dr van
der Elst told BBC News.</p>
            <p>When compared with global records of larger earthquakes, a
pattern became clear: there was a pronounced increase in
earthquakes of magnitude 3 or greater following large events
elsewhere in the world, such as the <a href="/1/hi/world/americas/8540289.stm"
               title="Massive earthquake strikes Chile">February 2010 event in Chile</a>
or the <a href="/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/9423880.stm"
               title="As it happened: Japan earthquake on Sunday">March 2011 Tohoku
event off Japan</a>.</p>
            <p>"When you have a really big earthquake somewhere else on the
planet, this sets up big seismic waves that spread out like ripples
over the surface of the Earth. When these seismic waves pass faults
that are already very near to failure, these seismic waves can give
that additional push that sets off an earthquake."</p>
            <p>Dr van der Elst said that these correlations of mid-size
earthquakes with distant events could be used as a useful test of a
site's integrity.</p>
            <p>"If you've had a quiet injection site in the past, you'd like to
be able to know if that site has transitioned, reached some
critical threshold where larger earthquakes are possible," he
said.</p>

            </div>
            <p>"If you can use this method as a kind of stress meter to show
where the stresses are building, that might be really useful for
making policy decisions about whether to keep pumping there or
whether to try a different site."</p>
            <p>Richard Davies, director of the Durham Energy Institute at the
University of Durham, called the paper "an exciting, interesting
result".</p>
            <p>"Seismologists have known for some time that there are transient
stresses from earthquakes that can potentially cause other faults
to slip, causing an earthquake," Prof Davies told BBC News.</p>
            <p>"But this paper is a very interesting contribution, as it
proposes that mankind can artificially 'prime the faults' by
injecting wastewater over long periods under the ground.</p>
            <p>"Mankind is essentially lubricating the faults enough so that
they are eventually triggered by a distant, natural earthquake.
Think of a hovercraft - the air pumped into the base of the craft
means that even small forces allow the heavy vehicle to move - the
physics is the same."</p>
