            <p class="introduction">It's 70 years since
Kursk, the largest ever tank battle. Will there ever be another
battle involving thousands of tanks on each side or has armoured
warfare had its day?</p>
            <p>Before dawn on 5 July 1943 explosions lit up the Russian sky and
the earth shook to a huge bombardment. As the sun rose, waves of
German panzers began rolling across fields of sunflowers and wheat.
The greatest tank battle in history was underway.</p>
            <p>The Battle of Kursk pitted almost 3,000 German tanks against
more than double that quantity of Soviet heavy armour.</p>
            <p>Hitler delayed the offensive - codenamed Operation Citadel - to
wait for the arrival of the new Panther. It gave the Russians
plenty of time to dig formidable defences and concentrate their own
armoured units.</p>
            <p>Antony Beevor, author of The Second World War, describes the
battle as a "slogging match".</p>
            <p>The German tanks were fewer in number but far superior in armour
and firepower. Tigers and the "monster" Ferdinand tank destroyer
went in first, attempting to blast their way through.</p>
            <p>One SS tank commander destroyed 22 Soviet
tanks in under an hour, Beevor says. But the Russians defended with
"suicidal bravery", getting in close to throw mines under the
caterpillar tracks.</p>
            <p>After eight days the German attack had run out of steam. Stalin
launched counteroffensives that over the following six weeks
inflicted a crushing defeat on the Wehrmacht.</p>
            <p>Kursk was a tipping point for the panzers, says Beevor. For the
first time the Russian air force had "got its act together". Air
power was emerging as a dominant factor, as became clear in
Normandy the following year.</p>
            <p>Allied air superiority meant that the German panzers had to hide
in the forests during daylight hours. The tank, like the
battleship, was suddenly a sitting duck without control of the
skies.</p>
            <p>But unlike the battleship, the tank remains a key part of most
militaries. According to the International Institute for Strategic
Studies there are 60,000 tanks in active service worldwide.</p>
            <p>During the Cold War, thousands of tanks were based close to West
and East Germany as a potential invading or defensive force for a
battle on the north European plain. "There's no question tanks
would have been one of the foremost instruments in an invasion or
defence," says Michael Codner, director of military sciences at the
Royal United Services Institute.</p>
            <p>When the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising in 1956 they did
so by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/4/newsid_2739000/2739039.stm">
sending hundreds of tanks into Budapest</a>.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The Yom Kippur War in 1973, when Egypt and Syria attacked
Israeli forces, involved over 3,000 tanks.</p>
            <p>US and UK forces used them to liberate Kuwait in 1991 and invade
Iraq in 2003. At the Battle of Fallujah, US Marines brought in
extra armoured brigades to help in the street fighting.</p>
            <p>But tank offensives are usually limited to flat areas like
desert, plain or steppe. In the jungles of Vietnam and the
mountains of Afghanistan, the helicopter has proved itself to be a
far more useful weapon.</p>
            <p>In the 1980s, the MoD commissioned a
paper considering whether the UK should replace its tanks with
helicopters, Codner recalls. In the end their use in supporting
infantry in seizing territory was deemed too important.</p>
            <p>But the British Army has deployed none of its Challenger tanks
to Afghanistan.</p>
            <p>The tank's importance is as much symbolic as tactical. It can be
used for good or ill.</p>
            <p>Faced by the 1989 student protest at Tiananmen Square the
Chinese authorities deployed tanks. And Saddam Hussein used it as a
"military status symbol", says Beevor. On the other hand,
peacekeepers need tanks to face down bullies, he notes.</p>
            <p>"In Bosnia things only changed when the tanks went in. That's
when the Serbs backed off."</p>
            <p>Nato has drastically cut its tank numbers since the end of the
Cold War, says Christopher Foss, editor of Jane's Armoured Fighting
Vehicles. Germany was host to 4,000 and Britain and France over
1,000 each at one time. Now they have cut back to a quarter or a
third of those numbers. Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/us-army-s-last-tanks-depart-from-germany-1.214977">
the last US battle tanks left Europe</a>.</p>
            <p>"Tankies" say heavy armoured vehicles have been written off many
times before, only to be contradicted by events. At the end of the
Cold War it was difficult to see a need for British tanks. Yet a
year later the 7th Armoured Brigade was charging through the desert
to liberate Kuwait, notes Beevor.</p>
            <p>In 2003, the Canadian government <a href="http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/observer/story.html?id=95b4c9e5-de13-4425-bc87-218c1031583c">
announced it was getting rid of its Leopard tanks</a>. "We are
losing a millstone that has hamstrung our thinking for years," Lt
Gen Rick Hillier said. Yet the policy was later reversed and dozens
of Leopard 2s have been acquired by the Canadian military.</p>

            <p>Today the UK has 334 tanks.</p>
            <p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman says the UK is still committed
to heavy armour: "The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review
(SDSR) recognised the need for an agile and capable force, which
included the continued requirement for tanks to provide a unique
capability." The UK's Challenger 2 tanks will be in service until
roughly 2035, thanks to a "life extension programme", the spokesman
adds.</p>
            <p>Outside Europe tanks numbers are rising,
Foss says. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia is upgrading its
US-made M1 tanks, Qatar has opted for the Leopard 2. China is
replacing its tanks, South Korea is self sufficient, India and
Pakistan have large numbers already. Asian countries without a
tradition of tanks are building up their forces. Singapore and
Indonesia have opted for the Leopard 2, while Malaysia has ordered
Polish tanks.</p>
            <p>Used properly - with infantry, engineers and close air support -
they are still a crucial part of a military's capability, says
former US tank officer Robert Forczyk, author of a forthcoming book
about Kursk. "They provide the sharp point of the spear that can
break through defences and advance rapidly to seize key objectives.
Only airborne forces offer a similar versatility."</p>
            <p>Day and night vision equipment gives modern tanks a big
advantage over their WWII equivalents. A Tiger tank's powerful gun
could finish off one of today's light armoured vehicles. But it
would be impotent against a modern battle tank, says Foss. "The
Challenger would open fire before the Tiger even knew it was there,
and penetrate its armour."</p>
            <p>But 70 years after Kursk, is a tank battle on that scale still
possible?</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, says Forczyk. Various countries that have fought in
the past have massive tank numbers.</p>

            </div>
            <p>India has 3,250 and Pakistan 2,400. In the Middle East, Egypt
has 2,500 and Syria 3,000, while Israel (500 in active service,
2000 stored) has regularly used tanks in recent conflicts.</p>
            <p>It's possible to "wargame" purely
hypothetical conflicts.</p>
            <p>China has more than twice as many as any other nation at 7,450.
Russia has 3,300. But the threat of a tank battle between North
(3,500) and South Korea (2,500) is perhaps a more realistic
possibility.</p>
            <p>In the battles of the future, the tanks may be unrecognisable
from the Russian T34 and German Tiger that did battle at Kursk.
Military technology has reached the point where unmanned tanks - a
land drone - are now possible, says Codner.</p>
            <p>For traditional "tankies" it may be a different kind of beast
altogether.</p>

            <h2>Why Operation Citadel failed</h2>
            <p>The German high command was divided about Citadel. Erich von
Manstein, attacking the southern shoulder of the salient, and
Walther Model, attacking the northern, were deeply sceptical.</p>
            <p>Model argued that the operation's objective was so obvious that
the Soviet high command had ample time to turn the salient into a
massively fortified place d'armes from which they could launch a
heavy armour counterblow.</p>
            <p>Hitler's misgivings led to Citadel's overlong gestation. This
generated much signals traffic, which was intercepted by British
code-breakers and passed on to Russia.</p>
            <p>Stalin presided over a battle-hardened Red Army capable of
riding German armoured punches. By the time the Western Allies
provided a further distraction with the invasion of Sicily on 10
July, the battle had already been lost. The Soviet counteroffensive
- Kutuzov - was launched two days later.</p>
            <p>It was the death of Blitzkrieg.</p>

            <h2>Five more major tank battles</h2>
            <p>
               <strong>1917 Battle of Cambrai</strong> - One of biggest early
tank battles, fought between British and Germans. The British
attempted to break through the Hindenburg Line. About 475 tanks
were used and both sides lost about 45,000 soldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>1942 Second Battle of El Alamein</strong> - More than
1,000 Allied tanks fought 547 Axis counterparts, which saw the
Germans effectively lose their battle for possession of Egypt and
the much-prized Suez Canal. Tanks played a key role, with Allied
forces receiving 300 Sherman tanks from the US.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>1965 Battle of Chawinda</strong> - Part of the 1965
Indo-Pakistani War, the forces were fairly evenly matched, with the
Indian Army commanding 225 tanks and the Pakistani Army controlling
282. The war ended after a UN resolution prompted an unconditional
surrender from both sides.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>1973 Battle of the Valley of Tears</strong> - The Yom
Kippur War, between Israel and an Arab coalition led by Egypt and
Syria, saw coalition forces march into Israeli territory. Tanks
were central to their surprise attack in the Golan Heights. But the
Syrians - with about 1,200 tanks to the Israelis' 100 - were unable
to defeat them before retreating.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>1991 Battle of 73 Easting</strong> - Decisive Gulf War
victory for US and British forces in their Desert Storm operation
in Iraq. The Iraqis lost more than 160 tanks.</p>

            <h2>Little Willie, the world's first tank</h2>
            <p>In 1915, Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty,
created a Landships Committee to tackle the problems of trench
warfare.</p>
            <p>Little Willie was running by the end of 1915 but a new design
was already under construction, which would become the prototype
for British heavy tanks in WWI.</p>
            <p>Little Willie never saw combat, but it represented a major step
forward in military technology. Lessons from this pilot project
helped shape the vehicles that would supersede it.</p>
