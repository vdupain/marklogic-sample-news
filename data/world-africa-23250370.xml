            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A key party in
Morocco's Islamist-led government has quit, amid a dispute over
subsidy cuts and economic policy.</p>
            <p>The secular centre-right Istiqlal party said five of its six
ministers had resigned. It is not clear if Education Minister
Mohammed el-Ouafa has done so.</p>
            <p>Istiqlal is the second-largest party in parliament after the
moderate Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD), which won
elections held in late 2011.</p>
            <p>The PJD will now have to find a new coalition partner or call
elections.</p>
            <p>Analysts say the first option is more likely.</p>
            <p>Announcing its withdrawal from the government on Tuesday,
Istiqlal spokesman Adil Benhamza accused Prime Minister Abdelilah
Benkirane of "acting like the head of a political party rather than
the head of a government that represents the people", Reuters news
agency reports.</p>
            <p>Istiqlal, which controlled the finance
ministry, has criticised the government's plan to cut by about 20%
subsidies of basic goods, which cost about $6.16bn
(Ã‚Â£4.14bn), or 6.4% of GDP. The cuts are due
to take effect at the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan,
which begins on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>The state has raised wages, pensions and spent more on subsidies
every year since Morocco - ruled by the Arab world's
longest-serving dynasty - saw protests over unemployment and living
costs inspired by the Arab Spring revolts of 2011.</p>
            <p>However, the government has recently been put under pressure to
rein in spending and reduce its budget deficit from 7.1% to 3% by
2017 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has granted it
a $6.2bn credit line.</p>
            <p>"The PJD wants to raise prices and hit the poorest, while we
prefer to pick up some billions which are in the hands of
speculators by controlling imports," Mr Benhamza told Reuters.</p>
            <p>The PJD has accused Istiqlal of trying to sabotage reforms, the
Associated Press news agency reports.</p>
            <p>Morocco imports all of its oil, gas and coal, and relies on
sugar and wheat shipments to meet domestic needs.</p>
            <p>Mr Benkirane has said the IMF criticised the government last
month for acting too hesitantly in implementing the financial
reforms.</p>
            <p>The government crisis in Morocco comes less than a week after
Egypt's Islamist President, Mohammed Morsi, was ousted by the
country's military.</p>
            <p>Istiqlal leader Hamid Chabat has meanwhile been quoted as saying
that he wants "the end of Benkirane, as was the case for his
brother Morsi", AP reports.</p>
