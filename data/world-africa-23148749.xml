            <p class="introduction">Members of former
South African President Nelson Mandela's family have laid a
criminal complaint against his grandson Mandla.</p>
            <p>Police spokesman Mzukisi Fatyela told the BBC officers would
investigate allegations of illegal grave tampering.</p>
            <p>A public prosecutor would then decide whether to press charges,
he said.</p>
            <p>It involves the bodies of three of the ex-president's children,
who were allegedly moved from a family graveyard about two years
ago by Mandla Mandela.</p>
            <p>In a separate case, 16 Mandela family members are seeking to
move the bodies back to the graveyard in the village of Qunu, where
Mr Mandela, who is critically ill in hospital with a recurring lung
infection, wants to be laid to rest.</p>
            <p>The case is being heard at the Mthatha High Court in Eastern
Province and has been postponed until Wednesday.</p>
            <p>Last week, the court granted an interim order for the remains to
be exhumed and moved from Mandla Mandela's homestead in the village
of Mvezo to nearby Qunu, 22km (14 miles) away.</p>
            <p>But Mandla Mandela, who was appointed as chief of Mvezo by his
grandfather, is now contesting that order.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says his plans to open a
heritage centre dedicated to his grandfather in Mvezo, in the
estate where the graves are at the moment, have left a bitter taste
in the mouths of many within the family.</p>
