cases</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Apple conspired with
publishers to fix the price of electronic books, a US judge has
ruled.</p>
            <p>Manhattan Judge Denise Cote said the iPad maker "conspired to
restrain trade".</p>
            <p>But the firm's spokesman, Tom Neumayr, said Apple would appeal
against the ruling and fight "false allegations".</p>
            <p>Five publishers that were originally named as defendants
alongside Apple have already reached settlements, including
Penguin.</p>
            <p>The judge ordered a new hearing to determine damages to be
imposed on Apple.</p>
            <p>The US Department of Justice said the conspiracy was designed to
challenge online retailer Amazon's dominance of the fast-growing
e-books market.</p>
            <p>Penguin settled its case for $75m
(Ã‚Â£49m). Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon
&amp; Schuster created a $69m fund for refunds to consumers, while
Macmillan settled for $26m.</p>
            <p>Judge Cote said: "The plaintiffs have
shown that the publisher defendants conspired with each other to
eliminate retail price competition in order to raise e-book prices,
and that Apple played a central role in facilitating and executing
that conspiracy.</p>
            <p>"Without Apple's orchestration of this conspiracy, it would not
have succeeded as it did in the spring of 2010," she said.</p>
            <p>US Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer called the ruling "a
victory for millions of consumers who choose to read books
electronically".</p>
            <p>He said the judge agreed with the Justice Department and 33
state attorneys general that executives at the highest levels of
Apple orchestrated a conspiracy with five major publishers to raise
prices.</p>
            <p>"Through today's court decision and previous settlements with
five major publishers, consumers are again benefiting from retail
price competition and paying less for their e-books,'' Mr Baer
said.</p>
            <p>Consumer groups in the US cheered the news.</p>
            <p>"If we let companies get away with this type of price fixing,
consumers will be denied a substantial part of the benefits of the
digital revolution," said Dr Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation
of America, which had filed a supporting brief in the case.</p>
            <p>But after the ruling, Mr Neumayr insisted that Apple had brought
innovation and competition to the market, not restricted it.</p>
            <p>"Apple did not conspire to fix e-book pricing and we will
continue to fight against these false accusations,'' he said.
"We've done nothing wrong."</p>
            <p>Previously, Apple's attorney, Orin Snyder, had told the court
that Judge Cote would set a "dangerous precedent" if she concluded
that Apple manipulated e-book prices.</p>
            <p>However, Columbia University law professor Scott Hemphill said
today's ruling was narrow and would be unlikely to set any legal
precedent.</p>
            <p>"It may send some signals to tech companies about what they can
and can't do," said Prof Hemphill.</p>
            <p>"But the precedential value is limited because the ruling is by
a district court."</p>
            <p>However, he added that the judge in this case took particular
pains to anticipate a challenge from Apple - something that chief
executive Tim Cook hinted at earlier this year, when he dismissed
the idea of a settlement.</p>

            <p>This is certainly a big win for the US government. But what's
interesting is how it proved its case.</p>
            <p>It was the collusion between publishers and Apple that caught
the eye of regulators and led to today's decision.</p>
            <p>The court relied heavily on incriminating internal emails from
Apple's Senior Vice President, Eddy Cue, to each of the publishers
named in the lawsuit.</p>
            <p>It also relied on testimony from the late Steve Jobs. Yes, Steve
Jobs.</p>
            <p>That came from transcripts of interviews with Walter Isaacson,
the author of Mr Jobs' biography.</p>
