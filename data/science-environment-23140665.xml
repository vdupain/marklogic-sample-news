            <p class="introduction">An unmanned Russian
Proton-M rocket has crashed just seconds after its launch from the
Russian Baikonur facility in Kazakhstan.</p>
            <p>Dramatic video footage broadcast by Russian TV shows the rocket
break up before exploding into a fireball over the Baikonur
cosmodrome.</p>
            <p>Russia's Interfax news agency reported that up to 500 tonnes of
poisonous rocket fuel may have been released and contaminated the
crash site.</p>
            <p>There were no reported injuries.</p>
            <p>The rocket was carrying three satellites for Russia's Glonass
(global) navigation satellite system.</p>
            <p>It is not yet clear what caused the accident.</p>
            <p>It is not the first incident involving a Proton-M rocket,
according to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.</p>
            <p>A similar rocket crashed shortly after it was launched six years
ago, and in 2010 another rocket failed to put three navigation
satellites into orbit.</p>
