            <p class="introduction">Eleven people have
drowned after a boat capsized in the flooded Kosi river in the
eastern Indian state of Bihar.</p>
            <p>The victims, including eight children, were returning home on
Thursday night from a village across the river after attending a
funeral, police said.</p>
            <p>On Friday morning, grieving relatives gathered on the river bank
in Madhepura district, 340km (210 miles) from the state capital,
Patna, as rescuers pulled out bodies.</p>
            <p>Reports said 24 people swam to safety.</p>
            <p>Boats in India are often overloaded, and lax safety standards
mean accidents are common on the river.</p>
            <p>Last year, 108 people died after a ferry capsized during a storm
in Assam.</p>
            <p>In October 2010, at least 36 people died after an overloaded
boat sank in the Ganges river in Bihar state.</p>
            <p>In 2009, a tourist boat carrying 76 people capsized in a lake in
Kerala, killing at least 37 people.</p>
