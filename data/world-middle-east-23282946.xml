               <span style="width:464px;">Morsi supporters are holding a
round-the-clock sit-in calling for his reinstatement</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Supporters and
opponents of the ousted Egyptian Islamist President Mohammed Morsi
are preparing to stage large rallies in Cairo on the first Friday
of the fasting month of Ramadan.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi's supporters hope that millions will continue to back
their call for his reinstatement.</p>
            <p>Those whose mass demonstrations led to his removal by the
military last week will gather in Tahrir Square.</p>
            <p>Dozens of people have died in deadly clashes since Mr Morsi's
ousting.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Jim Muir in Cairo says Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood
movement may have alienated many people while in office, but many
Egyptians are also uneasy at the military's intervention in the
country's politics, and what is emerging is a battle for public
opinion and the middle ground.</p>
            <p>On Thursday the US urged Egypt's leadership to stop the new
authorities' "arbitrary" arrests of Muslim Brotherhood members,
warning against targeting any particular group.</p>
            <p>UN chief Ban Ki-moon has also warned against the exclusion of
any party from the political process.</p>
            <p>However, White House spokesman Jay Carney said that the
administration did not believe it should immediately suspend aid to
Egypt.</p>
            <p>Washington is due to send four F-16 fighter jets to Egypt, but
has not publicly confirmed that the delivery will go ahead.</p>
            <p>The US administration says it is examining whether the military
takeover constitutes a coup - US law prohibits the sending of aid
to any country whose elected leader is deposed by a military
coup.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi's supporters have been staging mass protests throughout
the week near the Presidential Guard barracks in eastern Cairo,
where they believed he is being held.</p>

                 alt="Morsi opponents break fast on Tahrir Square - 11 July"/>
               <span style="width:464px;">Both sides have been celebrating iftar -
breaking the daily fast at sun-down - in the first days of
Ramadan</span>
            </div>
            <p>The focal point of the protest is the Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque,
where they are camping out around the clock in their thousands.</p>
            <p>Our correspondent says the Brotherhood is not planning any
marches but organisers are hoping that a massive turnout will show
support snowballing in their favour.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi's supporters say they are not seeking confrontation or
violence, but given the bitterly polarised situation, with feelings
running high on both sides, the potential is always there, he
adds.</p>
            <p>Their opponents are planning rallies for Tahrir Square,
including a mass iftar - breaking the fast.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi's removal - a year after he was elected - followed
protests by millions of people across Egypt.</p>
            <p>While the new authorities have not specified where Mr Morsi is,
a foreign ministry spokesman has said he is in a "safe place" and
being treated in a "very dignified manner".</p>
            <p>However, dozens of people have died in deadly clashes in the
aftermath of his ousting. On Monday alone more than 50 Morsi
loyalists were killed in clashes with the army.</p>
            <p>The Muslim Brotherhood's spiritual leader, Mohammed Badie, and
nine other senior figures were charged on Wednesday with inciting
Monday's violence, despite conflicting accounts of the
incident.</p>
            <p>Mr Badie's whereabouts are not known.</p>
