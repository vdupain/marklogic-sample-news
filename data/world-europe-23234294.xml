            <p class="introduction">Turkish police have
fired tear gas and water cannon at people trying to enter an
Istanbul park that was the focus of last month's anti-government
protests.</p>
            <p>Istanbul's governor reopened Gezi Park - next to Taksim Square -
to the public earlier on Monday, but shut it again after protest
leaders called a rally.</p>
            <p>The park had been shut since 15 June, when police ejected people
occupying it in protest at redevelopment plans.</p>
            <p>The authorities' response to the protest sparked nationwide
unrest.</p>
            <p>Four people were killed and thousands more were injured as
police cracked down on anti-government demonstrators, who accused
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of becoming increasingly
authoritarian.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of people flocked to Gezi Park on Monday afternoon
after Istanbul governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu declared it open once
again.</p>
            <p>Mr Mutlu said staff had tried to improve the park while it was
sealed off, planting additional trees and shrubs and replacing
damaged grass.</p>

            </div>
            <p>But, in a clear warning to protesters, he also warned that it
was no place for "forums, occupations or marches".</p>
            <p>"Blocking the parks, making them areas for demonstrations,
preventing children, elderly and [others] from using these areas
and turning this into a security problem - we would never ever
allow that," he told reporters.</p>
            <p>Taksim Solidarity, a group of political parties and
non-governmental organisations, subsequently called a public
meeting in the park at 19:00 (16:00 GMT), prompting the authorities
to close it after only three hours.</p>
            <p>Dozens of people were forced to leave by police, who used their
shields to eject some who resisted.</p>
            <p>Officers then used tear gas and water cannon to break up a crowd
of several thousand people marching along Istanbul's main shopping
street towards Taksim Square, according to the Reuters news
agency.</p>
            <p>On Saturday, police prevented thousands of people trying to
enter Gezi Park as part of a rally called by Taksim Solidarity to
serve notice to the authorities of a court decision that annulled
the redevelopment plan.</p>
            <p>An administrative court said locals had not been consulted
sufficiently about replacing the park with a replica of an
Ottoman-era military barracks and a mosque, and that the work would
not serve the public.</p>
            <p>However, the ruling is not final and the government is expected
to appeal.</p>
