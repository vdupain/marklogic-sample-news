            <p class="introduction">A candidate in next
week's regional elections in Mexico has been critically injured in
a gun attack in the south of the country.</p>
            <p>Rosalia Palma, a candidate of the governing PRI party for the
Oaxaca state assembly, was hit when her vehicle was fired on,
officials said.</p>
            <p>Her husband and an aide were killed.</p>
            <p>Violence has marred the election campaign, the first since
President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power last December.</p>
            <p>He has promised to review Mexico's "war on drugs" policy.</p>
            <p>More than 70,000 people are estimated to have died in
drug-related violence under the presidency of Felipe Calderon
between 2006 and 2012.</p>
            <p>Saturday's attack comes two days after the leader of the
left-wing Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) in Oaxaca, Nicolas
Estrada, was found dead with gunshot wounds.</p>
            <p>On Friday, two candidates in the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa
dropped out of the race after a member of their coalition was
killed.</p>
