            <p class="introduction">France has
apologised to Bolivia for refusing to allow President Evo Morales'
jet into its airspace, blaming "conflicting information".</p>
            <p>Bolivia accused France, Italy, Spain and Portugal of blocking
the plane.</p>
            <p>It said some wrongly believed US fugitive Edward Snowden was on
board.</p>
            <p>Speaking in Berlin, French President Francois Hollande said he
granted permission as soon as he knew it was Mr Morales' plane.</p>
            <p>President Morales was flying back to Bolivia from Moscow when
the plane was forced to stop in Vienna.</p>
            <p>The French foreign ministry issued a statement on the
incident.</p>
            <p>Ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot said: "The foreign minister
called his Bolivian counterpart to tell him about France's regrets
after the incident caused by the late confirmation of permission
for President Morales' plane to fly over [French] territory."</p>

            </div>
            <p>The episode sparked angry reactions from heads of state across
Latin America.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner referred to
"not only the humiliation of a sister country, but of the South
American continent".</li>
               <li>Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said on Twitter: "I
reaffirm all our solidarity with Evo [Morales] and from Venezuela,
with dignity, we will respond to this dangerous, disproportionate,
and unacceptable aggression"</li>
               <li>Ecuador's President Rafael Correa tweeted: "We express our
solidarity with Evo [Morales] and the brave Bolivian people."</li>
               <li>A statement by Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff said: "The
embarrassment to President Morales hits not only Bolivia, but all
of Latin America."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Demonstrators marched on the French embassy in La Paz, burning
the French flag and demanding the expulsion of the ambassador to
Bolivia.</p>
            <p>President Correa asked that the Unasur group of South American
nations call an urgent meeting over the matter.</p>
            <p>The secretary general of the Organization of American States
(OAS), Jose Miguel Insulza, <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/media_center/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-262/13">
expressed his "deep displeasure"</a> with the "lack of respect"
shown by the countries that denied airspace to Mr Morales' jet.</p>
            <p>Bolivia's Vice-President Alvaro Garcia said a group of Latin
American leaders would meet in Cochabamba, Bolivia, on Thursday
over the case.</p>
            <p>Austrian officials said the airport
authorities had searched the plane, but with Mr Morales's
permission.</p>
            <p>But the Bolivian government denied any search had taken
place.</p>
            <p>The plane took off from Vienna on Wednesday morning, having
landed there late on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, France urged EU-US trade talks be delayed amid the
fallout from secrets leaked by Mr Snowden.</p>
            <p>The talks are due to begin on Monday but claims that the US
bugged EU diplomatic offices in the US, and spied on internal
computer networks, have upset transatlantic relations.</p>
            <p>However, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
Berlin did not back a delay to the talks, which correspondents say
if successful will deliver the biggest trade deal in history.</p>
            <p>Mr Snowden is still believed to be in Moscow's Sheremetyevo
airport, from where he is seeking asylum in Bolivia and several
other countries.</p>
            <p>He is wanted by the US on charges of leaking secrets he gathered
while working as a contractor for the National Security Agency
(NSA), America's electronic spying agency.</p>
            <p>The leaking of thousands of classified intelligence documents
prompted revelations that the US has been systematically seizing
vast amounts of phone and web data.</p>
            <p>China, Russia and several European countries have expressed
anger with the US over the apparent scale of its surveillance
programme.</p>
