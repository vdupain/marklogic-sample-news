            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Bolivia has accused
European countries of an "act of aggression" for refusing to allow
its presidential jet into their airspace, amid suggestions US
fugitive Edward Snowden was on board.</p>
            <p>Bolivia said France, Italy, Spain and Portugal had blocked the
plane.</p>
            <p>President Evo Morales was flying back to Bolivia from Moscow
when the plane was forced to stop in Vienna.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, France has urged EU-US trade talks be delayed amid
the fallout from secrets leaked by Mr Snowden.</p>
            <p>The talks are due to begin on Monday but claims that the US
bugged EU diplomatic offices in the US, and spied on internal
computer networks, have upset transatlantic relations.</p>
            <p>French government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Berkacem said the
talks should be suspended for 15 days to enable mutual trust to be
restored.</p>
            <p>However, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
Berlin did not back a delay to the talks, which correspondents say
if successful will deliver the biggest trade deal in history.</p>
            <p>Once grounded in Vienna, Mr Morales' jet
was reportedly searched for Mr Snowden.</p>
            <p>He was apparently not on board and is still believed to be in
Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, from where he is reportedly seeking
asylum in Bolivia and several other countries.</p>
            <p>The incident came hours after Mr Morales said his country would
consider a request for political asylum from Mr Snowden.</p>
            <p>Bolivia's UN envoy Sacha Llorenti told reporters in Geneva that
he would complain to the UN about the European countries'
actions.</p>
            <p>"The decisions of these countries violated international law. We
are already making procedures to denounce this to the UN secretary
general," he said.</p>
            <p>But France denied refusing the plane permission, and Spain
subsequently said its airspace was open to the jet.</p>
            <p>Portugal said it had granted permission for the plane to pass
through its airspace but denied the plane's request to make a
refuelling stop in Lisbon because of unspecified technical
reasons.</p>
            <p>And an unnamed Vienna official told the Associated Press news
agency that Mr Morales had requested permission to land because
there was "no clear indication" the plane had enough fuel to
continue its flight.</p>
            <p>But Mr Llorenti continued to insist that permission to fly
through the countries' airspace had been denied at the bidding of
the US.</p>
            <p>"We have no doubt that it was an order from the White House...
For no reason whatsoever should a diplomatic plane with a president
[inside] be diverted from its route and forced to land in another
country."</p>
            <p>Demonstrators marched on the French embassy in La Paz, burning
the French flag and demanding the expulsion of the ambassador to
Bolivia over the affair, said reports.</p>
            <p>Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa asked that the Unasur group
of South American nations call an urgent meeting over the matter,
Unasur's secretary general said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>The secretary general of the Organization of American States
(OAS), Jose Miguel Insulza, <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/media_center/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-262/13">
expressed his "deep displeasure"</a> with the "lack of respect"
allegedly shown by the countries that denied airspace to Mr
Morales' jet.</p>
            <p>And Bolivia's Vice-President Alvaro Garcia said a group of Latin
American leaders would meet in Cochabamba, Bolivia, on Thursday to
discuss the case.</p>
            <p>Austrian officials said the airport
authorities had searched the plane, but with Mr Morales's
permission.</p>
            <p>The plane took off from Vienna on Wednesday morning, having
landed there late on Tuesday. It is now on its return journey to
Bolivia.</p>
            <p>Mr Morales said presidents should have the right to travel
anywhere in the world.</p>
            <p>"It's not an offence against the president, it is an offence
against the country, against the whole of the Latin American
region," he said before taking off.</p>
            <p>He described the incident as "almost a kidnapping of 13
hours".</p>
            <p>However, Eurocontrol - which co-ordinates Europe's airspace and
traffic control - said it was "a national decision whether or not
to accept a state flight" under the terms of the Chicago Convention
on International Civil Aviation.</p>
            <p>Mr Snowden is wanted by the US on charges of leaking secrets he
gathered while working as a contractor for the National Security
Agency (NSA), America's electronic spying agency.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Forcing the plane of a national president to land is a highly
unusual move. Bolivia says France, Spain, Portugal and Italy
initially denied the plane overflight rights. The assumption must
be that the United States asked some European countries to
intervene. It didn't want Edward Snowden slipping from their grasp
if he was on the plane.</p>
            <p>An Austrian government source tells me that having requested and
got the agreement of the Bolivians (because state immunity was
involved), Vienna airport police checked the identity of the five
crew members and six people accompanying President Morales. They
then searched the plane and found nothing.</p>
            <p>If the Americans did persuade several European countries to deny
overflight rights to the Bolivian president, it would suggest
Washington is winning the diplomatic argument in Europe's capitals
that Edward Snowden must be apprehended. The options for Mr Snowden
appear to be diminishing.</p>
