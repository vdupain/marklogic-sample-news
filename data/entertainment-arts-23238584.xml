            <p class="introduction">Sir Elton John has
said he is "lucky to be alive" after being diagnosed with
appendicitis.</p>
            <p>The singer told <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/5005726/Elton-John-appendix-abscess-cancels-tour.html">
The Sun</a> he had performed 10 concerts in "agony" on his European
tour before he called in doctors.</p>
            <p>"I was a ticking time bomb. I guess I could have died at any
time," he said.</p>
            <p>According to <a href="http://www.eltonjohn.com/news/news_details.aspx?postid=c3fd2163-de26-4808-bc48-4c64b26adc21#.UdwA8H9J6ms.twitter">
his website</a>, he is on a course of "intensive antibiotics" and
is expected to undergo surgery "in the coming weeks".</p>
            <p>Sir Elton has had to postpone a series of summer festival dates
including shows in Italy, Germany and London's Hyde Park this
week.</p>
            <p>A spokesman said the diagnosis had been made "following a number
of exploratory scans and blood tests with his medical team in the
UK".</p>
            <p>He confirmed the singer would not return to touring until he had
fully recovered from both the planned surgery and any damage caused
by the appendix abscess.</p>
            <p>"Elton is incredibly disappointed to postpone these tour dates,"
he said.</p>
            <p>"To know that he made such super-human efforts and continued to
perform to thousands through his illness only confirms his
dedication to his European fans.</p>
            <p>"He is eager to be back on top form and return to play the
remaining shows starting in early September 2013."</p>
            <p>Sir Elton had been due to perform at the Collisioni festival in
Italy on Tuesday, with further shows in Germany on Thursday and a
headline gig at London's Hyde Park on Friday.</p>
            <p>British Summer Time festival organisers AEG Live said the Hyde
Park show would still go ahead with Elvis Costello and former Kinks
frontman Ray Davies on the bill, with existing ticket holders
receiving a full refund.</p>
            <p>Other July dates now scrapped include festivals in Spain, France
and Monaco.</p>
            <p>Sir Elton is due back in the UK in September, performing at the
First Direct Arena in Leeds and at Bestival before heading back to
Las Vegas for a month-long residency at The Colosseum.</p>
