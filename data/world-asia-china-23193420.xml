            <p class="introduction">A court in Hong Kong
has sentenced a Feng Shui master to 12 years in jail for forging
the will of billionaire tycoon Nina Wang.</p>
            <p>After Ms Wang died in 2007, Peter Chan, formerly known as Tony
Chan, claimed he was the sole beneficiary of her estimated $4bn
(Ã‚Â£2.6bn) estate.</p>
            <p>The case of the eccentric billionaire widow and her alleged
geomancer lover transfixed Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>A court ruled two years ago that her estate would go to
charity.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Juliana Liu in Hong Kong reports that during the trial
the jurors heard many lurid and colourful stories about the
unlikely couple.</p>
            <p>They were told, for example, that Chan first wooed Nina Wang,
who was then one of Asia's richest women, with a head massage.</p>
            <p>When sentencing Chan, Justice Andrew Macrae spoke of the
"shameless and unparalleled greed" at the heart of a "well-executed
and well-planned" crime, Reuters news agency reports.</p>
            <p>"Never once ... have you shown the slightest remorse for your
conduct," he is quoted as saying.</p>
            <p>Chan, who had pleaded not guilty on charges of forgery and using
a forged document, was impassive during the sentencing, Reuters
reports.</p>
            <p>The self-styled Feng Shui practitioner changed his name from
Tony Chan to Peter Chan earlier this year after he converted to
Christianity.</p>
            <p>Chan fought for years to inherit the property tycoon's
multi-billion dollar fortune, claiming he was the sole beneficiary
according to a 2006 will.</p>
            <p>But a court finally dismissed his claims to the inheritance in
2011, ruling in favour of a charity run by Ms Wang's siblings,
Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd, whose claim to her estate
rests on a will from 2002.</p>
            <p>Ms Wang, who was 69 when she passed away, was known for her
pig-tails, short skirts and colourful dress sense.</p>
            <p>She was the widow of Hong Kong industrialist Teddy Wang, who
disappeared in 1990 after being kidnapped.</p>
