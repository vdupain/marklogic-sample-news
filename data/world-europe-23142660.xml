            <p class="introduction">Germany's standard dictionary has included
a vulgar English term, used by Chancellor Angela Merkel among
others, as an acceptable German word.</p>
            <p>Duden, the equivalent of the Oxford English Dictionary in the
UK, said it was reflecting the common use of the word "shitstorm"
among Germans.</p>
            <p>The word, which is used in German to denote a public outcry,
seems to have caught on during the eurozone crisis.</p>
            <p>German language experts voted it "Anglicism of the year" in
2012.</p>
            <p>One of them, Michael Mann, explained in <a href="http://www.thelocal.de/society/20120213-40703.html">a report by
the Local newspaper</a>, that the English word conveyed a "new kind
of protest... clearly different in kind and degree from what could
be expected in the past in response to a statement or action".</p>
            <p>In the past there have been controversies over German usage of
words like "download", "job-hopping" or "eye-catcher", the BBC's
Steve Evans reports from Berlin.</p>
            <p>The new word has crept into the language, imported by people who
heard its use primarily in American English, he says.</p>
            <p>It is used by the highest and lowest in the land and when
Chancellor Merkel used it at a public meeting, nobody batted an
eyelid, our correspondent adds.</p>
