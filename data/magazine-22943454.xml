               <span style="width:624px;">Latifa Nabizada often shares her cockpit
with her daughter - "She has grown up in a helicopter," she
says</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Col Latifa Nabizada,
the first female pilot in the Afghan air force, has battled
prejudice, the Taliban and personal tragedy - but her ambitions for
her young daughter soar even higher.</p>
            <p>My sister and I always talked about the stars and the
universe.</p>
            <p>We talked about how aeroplanes were made and what it would be
like to fly one - how it would feel to be a pilot. There were water
butts near where we lived and I used to climb on top and imagine I
was flying a helicopter.</p>
            <p>After we had finished school, Laliuma and I told our parents we
wanted to be professional pilots. They were quite shocked. At the
time, not many women in Afghanistan could work and there we were,
thinking of becoming pilots. But we managed to convince them. My
father's support was huge and it helped us a lot.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>Latifa and Laliuma were repeatedly denied admission to
the Afghan military school on medical grounds, but they eventually
joined in 1989 after being certified fit by a civilian doctor. No
women's uniforms existed, so they made their own.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>We were the first two women pilots in
Afghan air force history.</p>
            <p>The other students threw stones at us. We used to leave the
classroom in protest - then our teachers would come out and
apologise and we would go back in. We were all so young and such
things happened at that time. Considering the social conditions,
people were quite positive about it.</p>
            <p>We worked really hard and our exam results were quite good.</p>
            <p>Of course, our male classmates weren't that happy and felt a bit
jealous. But we didn't pay much attention to them. It was because
of our sheer interest in the subject, and also with the blessing of
God that we had potential and talent.</p>
            <p>My first independent flight was an unforgettable experience. It
was in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif, and the flight was part
of my examination.</p>
            <p>I flew - I flew and it felt really great. And I thought: "This
is what you get after all that hard work." At the time my teachers
kept saying: "Please pay attention! Look down at all those
government officials, look at all those flowers in their hand! They
are just waiting for you to come down and they will greet you."</p>
            <p>That was a tremendous feeling - but I really had to pay
attention to the landing. We have two kinds of landing and the
horizontal one takes a lot of accurate calculation.</p>
            <p>After becoming pilots, Laliuma and I were treated differently
from the male graduates. There was war at that time - some
provinces were secure and some provinces had conflict and
insurgency. At first, we were told to only fly in the secure
provinces.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>In 1996, the Taliban secured Kabul and Latifa and
Laliuma moved to Mazar-e Sharif.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>General Dostum was commander at the time in northern Afghanistan
and he helped us a lot, giving us a secure place to live. He wanted
the news to go out all over the world that he was a supporter of
women's rights. During his time we flew missions - we fought the
Taliban.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Mazar-e Sharif was taken by the Taliban
in 1998 - the last city in Afghanistan to fall to the
insurgency</span>
            </div>
            <p>
               <strong>But before long, the women were forced to flee to
Pakistan, where they wove carpets for several years, keeping a low
profile and fearing for their lives. Eventually they were able to
return to Kabul.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>When people said the Taliban were on the way out and there would
be another era for Afghanistan - women would work again, and be
allowed to go out, and be able to do whatever they wanted -
pleasant as that idea was, it was also unbelievable.</p>
            <p>I got to Kabul at night, but I just
couldn't wait. I went to the military base and said "I'm back and I
want to start working again". They told me that there would be a
celebration in Kabul in a couple of days' time and my first flight
would be during that celebration. And it was beautiful.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>Latifa and Laliuma were both married, and in 2006 they
became pregnant within weeks of one another. They kept the news
quiet from their commanding officers for as long as
possible.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>There was a need for us to fly and we flew a lot of missions
during our pregnancies. Despite that, I managed to bring Malalai
into the world well enough.</p>
            <p>But my sister had a difficulty in her childbirth. The doctor at
the time said she had a choice: "Do you want us to save your baby
or yourself?" And she was in love with her baby and she said "Save
the baby, whichever way you can."</p>
            <p>The next day at 16:00 she lost her life.</p>
            <p>All our life we had been together, played together, flown
together. She was my strength and I was hers. And we had been
through difficult missions and to the frontline, we had transferred
dead bodies and the injured.</p>
            <p>So many officials in the Air Force of Afghanistan told us: "We
will never see the likes of you two again." She was an incredibly
courageous woman.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell you how it feels every day without her, bringing
up her child.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">In March Latifa (fifth left) took part
in a photoshoot for International Women's Day</span>
            </div>
            <p>
               <strong>Latifa breast-fed her niece Mariam as well as her own
daughter, with her mother helping with childcare. She went back to
work within months of giving birth.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, there was nobody to take care of my daughter at
home and there is no kindergarten in the military. So most of the
time I took Malalai with me in the helicopter. She has grown up in
a helicopter - sometimes I think she's not my daughter, but the
helicopter's daughter!</p>
            <p>She was almost two months' old when we first flew together.</p>
            <p>She would fall into a deep sleep and
wasn't any problem. As she grew up, she'd stand next to me and
whenever she felt sleepy she would lay her head on my shoulder and
fall asleep. When our American advisers saw this they would say,
"Don't keep her here, she'll be in danger - put her in the cabin."
But Malalai used to cling onto my clothes and say, "Mum, I don't
want to go there, I don't want to go there!"</p>
            <p>I would assure my American colleagues that if she stayed with me
I would fly safely. We were very cautious - we only went together
on the routes that we knew were secure.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, my daughter goes to school during the day, but I have
asked the military to make a kindergarten for the other girls that
are coming off courses and starting their jobs here.</p>
            <p>Customarily, when you ask a kid whose child they are they give
their father's name, but Malalai always says "I am the daughter of
Pilot Latifa". She is immensely proud - and so am I.</p>
            <p>I think her journey will be much easier than the one Laliuma and
I had. I'm so thankful to my father, for all the support that he
gave us. Now, being a mother myself I'm aware of the difficulties a
parent faces raising a child, making sure that he or she achieves
all the goals that he or she desires.</p>
            <p>She is very interested in space. My ambition is for her to go to
space - to become the first astronaut for Afghanistan. I hope my
country will provide such opportunities by the time Malalai has
grown up.</p>
