            <p class="introduction">A second arrest has
been made in a murder investigation involving American football
player Aaron Hernandez, prosecutors say.</p>
            <p>Carlos Ortiz, 27, was detained in Connecticut accused of being a
fugitive from justice, say authorities.</p>
            <p>Mr Hernandez, 23, was charged on Wednesday with murder in
relation to last week's discovery of a fellow player's body in
Massachusetts.</p>
            <p>The NFL player has now been dropped by his team, the New England
Patriots.</p>
            <p>Mr Ortiz, who was arrested on Wednesday in Mr Hernandez's
hometown of Bristol, is in custody on bail of $1.5m (nearly
Ã‚Â£1m).</p>

            </div>
            <p>Mr Hernandez was taken from his home south of Boston,
Massachusetts, in handcuffs over the death of Odin Lloyd, 27, a
semi-professional player.</p>
            <p>He is also charged with firearms violations.</p>
            <p>During a bail hearing on Thursday, lawyer James Sultan said Mr
Hernandez was "not looking for any special treatment from this
court" and said the NFL player would not be a flight risk.</p>
            <p>But Judge Renee Dupuis disagreed and rejected Mr Hernandez's
request to be released on bail.</p>
            <p>"Given all the circumstances in this case, despite the fact that
he has a fiancee and a baby and is a homeowner, he also has the
means to flee," she said. "A bracelet just wouldn't keep him here -
nor would $250,000."</p>
            <p>Lloyd was found in a quiet corner of an industrial park not far
from Mr Hernandez's home.</p>
            <p>According to the victim's family, the two men had been
friends.</p>
            <p>Lloyd's girlfriend and Mr Hernandez's fiancee - who is the
mother of his eight-month-old baby - are sisters.</p>
            <p>The victim had been shot multiple times, authorities said. The
two men are believed to have had an argument some days earlier.</p>
            <p>Two days after that dispute, Mr Hernandez allegedly called two
unnamed friends and asked them to come to Massachusetts from the
neighbouring state of Connecticut.</p>

            <p>The group is said to have picked up Lloyd at home in the early
hours of 17 June. Surveillance footage from Mr Hernandez's home
appears to show him leaving with a gun.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors say that about an hour later, Lloyd texted his
sister: "Did you see who I am with.''</p>
            <p>When his sister asked whom, Lloyd replied "NFL", adding "Just so
you know".</p>
            <p>Minutes later, workers at the industrial park reported hearing
gunshots, say prosecutors.</p>
            <p>Mr Hernandez was drafted by the Patriots in 2010 after playing
at the University of Florida.</p>
            <p>His contract was renewed last year in a $40m deal.</p>
