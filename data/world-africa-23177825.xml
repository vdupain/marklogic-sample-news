al-Shabab in October 2012</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The apparently
accidental publication of a diplomatic letter has exposed a rift
between the Somali government and Kenyan troops - supposedly
allies.</p>
            <p>The letter, verified as genuine by the BBC, accuses the Kenyan
army of causing recent faction fighting that left at least 65 dead
in the port of Kismayo.</p>
            <p>Kenyan troops are part of the African Union force battling
Islamist militants in support of the UN-backed government.</p>
            <p>The Kenyan authorities have not yet commented on the letter in
detail.</p>
            <p>Some regional diplomats say Kenya is trying to create a buffer
state, known as Jubaland, inside Somalia run by local politicians
it can control.</p>
            <p>The letter is from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Fawzia Yusuf
Adam - who is also the deputy prime minister - to the African
Union.</p>
            <p>It is headed "Extremely Urgent - Kismayo conflict".</p>
            <div class="caption body-width">

                 alt="The leaked letter"/>
            </div>
            <p>A diplomat in Mogadishu said the letter appeared to have been
emailed to journalists in error.</p>
            <p>It seems, the diplomat said, that someone mistakenly added the
prime minister's "press contacts" into the email recipients'
list.</p>
            <p>A senior official in the president's office confirmed to the BBC
that the letter was genuine.</p>
            <p>The communication accuses the Kenyans, who are part of the
African Union peacekeeping force, Amisom, of not being neutral
peacekeepers.</p>
            <p>It says the Kenyan Defence Force (KDF) backed one Somali faction
against others, arrested a senior Somali government army officer
and used heavy weapons in areas containing civilians.</p>
            <p>What the letter bluntly called the "incompetence" of the Kenyan
commander of Amisom in southern Somalia is said to have caused an
outbreak of recent fighting in the southern port city of Kismayo
that had led to a "preliminary" count of 65 dead and 155
injured.</p>
            <div class="caption body-narrow-width">
               <img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/67456000/gif/_67456379_som_controlled_areas_070513.gif"

            </div>
            <p>The Kenyan Amisom contingent was recently reinforced by several
hundred troops from Sierra Leone.</p>
            <p>But the Sierra Leoneans are "embedded" inside Kenyan units, so
the KDF is very much the dominant force in this part of Somalia,
which is known in Amisom jargon as "Sector 2".</p>
            <p>The letter calls for the "immediate deployment" of a
multinational African peacekeeping force in southern Somalia.</p>
            <p>It doesn't go as far to say the Kenyans should be replaced, but
pointedly says new "political officers" should be appointed for the
area "whose nationalities will be different from the Amisom
contingent in Sector 2".</p>
            <p>This explosive diplomatic letter has only just been
revealed.</p>
            <p>Kenya has not yet officially responded to it.</p>
            <p>But the Kenyan army has earlier insisted it is neutral in its
dealings with Somalia and is trying to bring peace to its
neighbour.</p>
            <p>The Somali government accusations may nevertheless confirm
suspicions in the region that while the Kenyans are part of Amisom
they also have their own agenda.</p>
            <p>Kenyan forces seized the key port of Kismayo about 480km (300
miles) south of Mogadishu from the Islamist group al-Shabab in
October 2012.</p>
            <p>At the moment, there are several self-declared presidents of
Jubaland and the government has said it recognises none of
them.</p>
            <p>Although the AU and Somali government have driven al-Shabab from
most major cities, its fighters still control smaller towns and
rural areas in central and southern Somalia and they sometimes
launch attacks in government-controlled territory.</p>
            <p>The new government, formed last year, is the first one in more
than two decades to be recognised by the US and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
