               <span style="width:464px;">A ban on standing while watching matches is one of
the changes proposed</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Controversial new
plans which include a ban of shirtless and standing fans at Rio de
Janeiro's Maracana stadium are causing outcry in Brazil.</p>
            <p>Percussion instruments and flag poles traditionally used by
organised fan groups could also be banned, says the stadium's new
administration.</p>
            <p>Critics are calling the plans "colonisation" and
"gentrification" measures after the $450m modernisation.</p>
            <p>Maracana has been renewed to host the final match of next year's
World Cup.</p>
            <p>The plans were announced by the president of the stadium's
consortium, Joao Borba.</p>
            <p>"We will talk to the clubs aiming a change of habits. I'm
referring to bamboos [used as flag poles], bass drums, watching the
matches standing. We do not even have room for the bamboos," Mr
Borba told Rio's newspaper Extra.</p>
            <p>The changes are meant to safeguard the comfort, security and
accessibility of the fans, he explained.</p>

Maracana</span>
            </div>
            <p>But in a city where walking around wearing only shorts and
flipflops is as common a men's outfit as suit and tie, many do not
believe the changes can be implemented.</p>
            <p>Fans used blogs and social media to vent their anger at the
plan.</p>
            <p>"In the new Maracana, icon of a football undergoing
transformation, a war has been declared against people," blogger
David Butter wrote under the title "The colonisation of
Maracana".</p>
            <p>Hours after the announcement, users on Twitter were largely
critical of the plans.</p>
            <p>Another blogger saw an attempt of gentrifying football behind
the proposals.</p>
            <p>"So, away from the people, with expensive tickets and
surroundings that handpick the attendance, they decreed [new
rules]," wrote Rica Perroni.</p>
            <p>Maracana is expected to become once again the home ground of Rio
de Janeiro's main football teams.</p>
            <p>But so far, only current Brazilian league champions Fluminense
have signed a 35-year contract with the consortium.</p>
            <p>Botafogo, Vasco da Gama and Flamengo are expected to share
it.</p>
