            <p class="introduction">Nokia has agreed to
buy Siemens' 50% stake in their joint venture, Nokia Siemens
Networks (NSN), for 1.7bn euros ($2.2bn;
Ã‚Â£1.5bn).</p>
            <p>The deal comes at a time when NSN has started to show profits
after a series of cost cutting measures.</p>
            <p>Nokia, once a market leader in the mobile phone market, has
struggled in that sector amid increased competition.</p>
            <p>It said NSN, which makes telecom network equipment, would help
it grow in areas such as broadband technology.</p>
            <p>"Nokia Siemens Networks has established a clear leadership
position in LTE, which provides an attractive growth opportunity,"
Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop <a href="http://press.nokia.com/2013/07/01/nokia-to-fully-acquire-siemens-stake-in-nokia-siemens-networks/">
said in a statement</a>.</p>
            <p>"Nokia is pleased with these developments and looks forward to
continue supporting these efforts to create more shareholder value
for the Nokia group," he added.</p>
            <p>Shares in Nokia were down almost 2% in mid-morning trade, while
Siemens' shares were up 0.3%.</p>
            <p>The joint venture was launched in 2007 but struggled to make
profits in the early years.</p>
            <p>Its fortunes were hurt by a slowdown in demand after the global
financial crisis struck in 2008.</p>
            <p>At the same time, it also faced stiff competition from Chinese
telecom equipment makers such as Huawei and ZTE.</p>
            <p>However, NSN introduced cost cutting measures and in November
2011 announced 17,000 job cuts, which accounted for 23% of its
workforce.</p>
