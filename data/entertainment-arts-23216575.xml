            <p class="introduction">Art collector
Charles Saatchi says he is divorcing his wife, the television chef
Nigella Lawson.</p>
            <p>It follows the publication of photographs which showed him with
his hands around her throat at a London restaurant in June.</p>
            <p>Mr Saatchi, 70, who accepted a police caution for assault, told
the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2357634/Im-divorcing-Nigella-Saatchi-breaks-news-wife-exclusive-statement-Mail-Sunday-says-hes-sorry--insists-hand-throat-too.html">
Mail on Sunday</a> he had "clearly been a disappointment" to his
wife.</p>
            <p>He said it was a "heartbreaking" decision for him.</p>
            <p>Mr Saatchi said the couple had "become estranged and drifted
apart" over the past year.</p>
            <p>"I am sorry to announce that Nigella Lawson and I are getting
divorced," he told the newspaper.</p>
            <p>"I feel that I have clearly been a disappointment to Nigella
during the last year or so, and I am disappointed that she was
advised to make no public comment to explain that I abhor violence
of any kind against women, and have never abused her physically in
any way."</p>
            <p>"I am sorry that we had a row. I am sorry she was upset. I am
even more sorry that this is the end of our marriage," he
added.</p>
            <p>The pictures of the couple at a restaurant in Mayfair, central
London, showed Mr Saatchi grasping his wife's neck.</p>
            <p>The images, which were first published in the <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nigella-lawson-attacked-husband-see-1955564">
Sunday People</a>, provoked a public debate about domestic violence
among the rich and famous.</p>
            <p>Mr Saatchi dismissed the incident as "a playful tiff" but later
accepted a police caution for assault, saying he had done so to
stop the incident "hanging over" them.</p>
            <p>Ms Lawson has made no comment since the incident.</p>
            <p>Mr Saatchi, a former advertising executive, is a well known art
collector and owner of the Saatchi Gallery.</p>
            <p>He donated his Chelsea art gallery, including more than 200
works of art, to the British public in 2010.</p>
            <p>He and Ms Lawson have been married since 2003.</p>
            <p>She has two children, Cosima and Bruno, from her marriage to
journalist John Diamond, who died in 2001.</p>
            <p>Ms Lawson first began a restaurant column in The Spectator in
1985 and by the following year had become deputy literary editor of
The Sunday Times.</p>
            <p>She then went on to write the book How to Eat, followed by the
award-winning book, How to be a Domestic Goddess.</p>
            <p>Her television cookery programmes - including Nigella Bites and
Nigella's Christmas Kitchen - have brought her international
fame.</p>
