            <p class="introduction">The state
legislature in Texas has held a second special session to revive a
controversial bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of
pregnancy.</p>
            <p>The session was called by Republican Governor Rick Perry after a
Democratic senator used a delaying tactic called a filibuster to
block a vote last week.</p>
            <p>Supporters say the strict law would protect women's health and
the foetus.</p>
            <p>Critics say the measure would effectively force most abortion
clinics to close.</p>
            <p>More than 5,000 demonstrators gathered outside the state capitol
in Austin on Monday, mostly to oppose the proposed legislation.</p>
            <p>Democratic state Senator Wendy Davis told
the crowds their raucous support last Tuesday helped her to pull
off the filibuster, which lasted for about 12 hours.</p>
            <p>"You were at the crux of a turning point in Texas history," Sen
Davis told them.</p>
            <p>But Texas Republicans have vowed to pass the bill.</p>
            <p>"The world has seen images of pro-abortion activists screaming,
cheering," Gov Perry said. "Going forward, we have to match their
intensity but do it with grace and civility."</p>
            <p>Among the demonstrators who turned out on Monday were those who
favour the legislation. They prayed outside the Senate.</p>
            <p>The proposed bill would ban abortions in Texas after 20 weeks of
pregnancy, and require that only ambulatory surgical centres can
carry out the procedure.</p>

            <p>It would also only allow abortions to be performed by doctors
with admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.</p>
            <p>Only five of the 42 clinics in the state meet those
requirements.</p>
            <p>On Monday, the legislative session lasted for less than an hour
- just long enough to refer the bill to a committee.</p>
            <p>After that, public hearings on the measure must be held before
it can come to the floor of each chamber for consideration.</p>
            <p>Republican lawmakers have indicated they will try to move the
bill along quickly, so it can be passed before the end of the
30-day special session.</p>
            <p>Last week's filibuster drew nationwide attention and made Sen
Davis a heroine of the US abortion rights movement.</p>
            <p>The US Supreme Court legalised abortion nationwide in 1973, but
about a dozen conservative states have enacted laws in recent years
that seek to limit the procedure.</p>
