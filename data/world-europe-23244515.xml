            <p class="introduction">The final debate on
a bill allowing limited abortion in the Republic of Ireland has
been adjourned following an all-night session in the lower house of
the Irish parliament.</p>
            <p>Members of the DÃƒÂ¡il spoke until 04:57 BST
on Thursday.</p>
            <p>They are due to resume the debate on the Protection of Life
During Pregnancy Bill later this afternoon.</p>
            <p>The Irish government won the first two votes on a range of
amendments - more than 160 have been tabled.</p>
            <p>By the end of the debate only 11 of the 166 amendments had been
dealt with, making it more likely that the government will cut
short the debate and introduce a guillotine order later.</p>
            <p>European Affairs Minister Lucinda Creighton voted with the
government in the two overnight votes, but is expected to go
against the measure later this evening. If she does so, she will
lose her job and will automatically be expelled from the Fine Gael
party.</p>
            <p>In a surprise development in the last vote of the debate, Labour
TD Michael McNamara from Clare voted against the government. His
party said he had made a genuine mistake and pushed the wrong
voting button.</p>
            <p>The bill allows for a termination when three doctors unanimously
agree that a woman is at risk of taking her life.</p>
            <p>Anti-abortion activists say the measure could lead to more
widespread abortion.</p>
            <p>Others argue the bill is too limited as it does not allow for
terminations in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal
abnormality.</p>
            <p>Nor does it allow for termination when the foetus cannot survive
outside the womb.</p>
            <p>Anti-abortion campaigners say that the bill will allow the
intentional killing of the unborn for the first time in the
Republic of Ireland.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Anti-abortion activists want the law to
remain unchanged</span>
            </div>
            <p>For them, in a largely Catholic country, it is not just a
religious but a human rights issue as they believe that in any
pregnancy the mother and foetus have equal rights to life.</p>
            <p>Members of parliament (TDs) who support access to abortion say
the bill ignores the fact that, on average, 11 women leave the
country every day for an abortion in Britain.</p>
            <p>Since a Supreme Court ruling in 1992, known as the X case,
abortion has been constitutionally available when a woman's life,
as distinct from her health, is at risk from the continued
pregnancy.</p>
            <p>X was a suicidal 14-year-old schoolgirl who had been raped by a
neighbour and was initially prevented from leaving the country for
an abortion in Britain.</p>
            <p>Since then, the credible threat of suicide is, constitutionally,
regarded as grounds for a termination.</p>
            <p>But in the intervening years, until now, no government has
introduced legislation to give doctors legal certainty on when an
abortion can be carried out.</p>
            <p>And that uncertainty provided part of the context for the Savita
Halappanavar case.</p>
            <p>She was a 31-year-old Indian dentist who was admitted to
hospital in Galway in October 2012 while miscarrying.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">The death of Savita Halappanavar drew attention to
the lack of clarity about the legal position on
termination</span>
            </div>
            <p>She died a week later from septicaemia.</p>
            <p>Her request for an abortion was turned down.</p>
            <p>Her inquest heard that she could not get a termination at the
time because her life was not in danger but, by the time her life
was at risk, an abortion would have been too late to save her.</p>
            <p>Her inquest also heard there were systems failures in her health
care.</p>
            <p>The Fine Gael-Labour coalition government says its proposed
legislation will bring the law and constitution into line.</p>
            <p>In a vote last week, the government had an overwhelming 138 to
24 vote majority.</p>
