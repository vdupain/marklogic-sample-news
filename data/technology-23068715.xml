            <p class="introduction">Actress Kiera
Knightley once described the internet as "dehumanising" and said
she avoided it, while singer Sir Paul McCartney has previously
admitted to being baffled by High Street bank cash machines.</p>
            <p>Ms Knightley may have had a change of heart - she recently told
US chat show host Ellen de Generes that she had looked online for
advice about planning her wedding - but for many so-called "digital
deniers", the opportunity to block out technology is often
welcomed.</p>
            <p>"Technology is becoming more personal," security expert Graham
Cluley told the BBC.</p>
            <p>"We're going to see more and more devices that are carried on
your person or worn - I am expecting there to be something of a
backlash. Some people will love those things, others will find it
very upsetting."</p>
            <p>For those who consider themselves to be in the latter group,
technology - ironically - may provide the solution.</p>

glasses developed by the National Institute of Informatics in
Japan</span>
            </div>
            <p>The National Institute of Informatics in Japan has developed
prototype glasses that inhibit facial-recognition cameras.</p>
            <p>Described by some as the antidote to Google Glass, these specs
contain 11 LED lights along the eyebrows and nose.</p>
            <p>"The LEDs are installed around these locations because a feature
of face detection is the eyes and part of the nose appear dark,
while the other part of the nose appears bright," Prof Isao Echizen
told news website <a href="http://www.diginfo.tv/v/13-0050-r-en.php">diginfo.tv</a>.</p>
            <p>"So by placing light sources near the dark parts of the face,
we've succeeded in cancelling face detection characteristics,
making face detection fail."</p>
            <p>Prof Echizen is also developing visors that contain reflective
material or absorb light to inhibit cameras that do not rely on
infra-red.</p>

               <span style="width:226px;">This disposable poncho claims to offer protection
from an "irritating sea of wireless radiation"</span>
            </div>
            <p>Emil DeToffol, an engineering graduate and former dentist in New
York, founded the retail website <a href="http://lessemf.com/personal.html">lessEMF.com</a> in 1996 after
growing concerned about unproven health fears surrounding the
electromagnetic radiation commonly emitted by everyday
electronics.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Radiation/Pages/Introduction.aspx">The
NHS says on its website</a> that, so far, "a number of studies,
both in the UK and internationally, have not identified any health
risks associated with [telecommunications] devices" but adds that
"it may be too early to detect possible long-term risks or problems
that may be associated with them".</p>
            <p>But Mr DeToffol's company specialises in selling a variety of
products - ranging from baseball caps to bedding - containing
silver, copper, stainless steel or carbon fibres that reflect
radiation.</p>
            <p>"In the 1990s the issues were power lines, electric blankets,
CRT [cathode-ray tube] display screens - there was no wi-fi.
Cellphones were just getting started," Mr DeToffol told the
BBC.</p>
            <p>"Now, as our world becomes more electrified... people are
getting sicker."</p>
            <p>While he does not suffer himself, Mr DeToffol said he had heard
from customers around the world, complaining of a variety of
symptoms ranging from headaches and irritability to tinnitus and
cardiac issues.</p>
            <p>He did concede that radiation might not always be the cause.</p>
            <p>"At this point it is not the majority of the population, but it
is a certain percentage that's made quite ill by this," he
said.</p>
            <p>The company's best-sellers were its baseball cap and balaclava,
followed by "hoodie" tops that covered both head and torso, added
Mr DeToffol.</p>
            <p>"The issue comes down to what part of the body does the person
need to shield?" he said.</p>
            <p>"Most popular tends to be shielding for the head - particularly
for when people are sleeping."</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">An example of a Faraday Cage keeping out
electricity</span>
            </div>
            <p>Named after 19th Century British scientist Michael Faraday, a
Faraday cage is a metal construction that traps electromagnetic
waves.</p>
            <p>This means devices such as mobile phones or anything containing
a radio-frequency identification (RFID) chip - including passports,
travel cards and credit cards - are unable to receive or transmit
data from inside one.</p>
            <p>Wired magazine <a href="http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Make_a_Faraday_Cage_Wallet">published
an online guide for making a hand-sized Faraday Cage</a> out of
duct tape and aluminium foil for those concerned about the
possibility of the covert retrieval of information from cards and
gadgets via discreet scanners.</p>
            <p>One unnamed man who defected from North Korea attempted his own
interpretation of a Faraday cage during his time in the tightly
controlled regime - where mobile phone use is strictly monitored by
the authorities.</p>
            <p>"In order to make sure the mobile phone frequencies are not
being tracked, I would fill up a washbasin with water and put the
lid of a rice cooker over my head while I made a phone call," he is
quoted as saying in a research paper called <a href="http://audiencescapes.org/sites/default/files/A_Quiet_Opening_FINAL_InterMedia.pdf">
A Quiet Opening</a>.</p>
            <p>"I don't know if it worked or not, but I was never caught."</p>

                 height="171"
                 alt="hand holding paintbrush"/>
               <span style="width:304px;">The paint was said to be the first of
its kind that could absorb frequencies of 100
gigahertz</span>
            </div>
            <p>In 2009 researchers at the University of Tokyo developed a kind
of paint that can block wireless signals.</p>
            <p>The paint contains an aluminium oxide that resonates at the same
frequency as wi-fi, blocking the path of data both in and out of an
indoor environment where the paint is present.</p>
            <p>The idea of radio frequency blocking paint was not new even then
- but this was the first of its kind to absorb frequencies of 100
gigahertz, the researchers said.</p>
            <p>"The very existence of 'anti-technology' means that people are
worried and we should take that seriously," said technologist Suw
Charman-Anderson.</p>
            <p>"We need to have to a public discussion about what we find
acceptable and what we don't.</p>
            <p>"Anybody who thinks they are not being tracked may be a little
naÃƒÂ¯ve - if you buy your groceries with a
credit card or use a loyalty card then you are being tracked," she
added.</p>
            <p>"But the level of vigilance that would be needed to completely
hide yourself would probably have negative consequences on your
emotional wellbeing - I think we have to pick our battles."</p>
