               <span style="width:304px;">Former Chadian President Hissene Habre has lived in
Senegal for more than two decades</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Police in Senegal
have arrested Chad's former leader Hissene Habre, who is wanted for
alleged atrocities during his eight-year rule.</p>
            <p>Mr Habre's lawyer El Hadji Diouf said he was taken from his home
in Dakar by paramilitary police to an unknown location on
Sunday.</p>
            <p>The 70 year old has been under house arrest since 2005 in
Senegal, where he fled after being deposed in 1990.</p>
            <p>He denies killing and torturing tens of thousands of his
opponents.</p>
            <p>Last year the UN's International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered
Senegal to put him on trial or extradite him to face justice
overseas.</p>
            <p>His arrest comes days after US President Barack Obama praised
the efforts of Senegal's current President Macky Sall to bring him
to trial at the start of his Africa tour.</p>
            <p>Human rights group have been pushing Senegal to put Mr Habre on
trial for decades.</p>
            <p>Senegalese MPs passed a law in December
allowing a special African Union tribunal to be created in the
country to try the former leader, who has been dubbed "Africa's
Pinochet".</p>
            <p>The charges against him date from 1982, when Mr Habre came to
power in a coup, until 1990, the year he was ousted.</p>
            <p>Mr Habre was first indicted in Senegal in 2000 - but the
country's courts ruled at the time that he could not be tried
there.</p>
            <p>His alleged victims then filed complaints under Belgium's
universal jurisdiction law, which allows the country's judges to
prosecute human rights offences committed anywhere in the
world.</p>
            <p>He was charged by Belgium with crimes against humanity and
torture in 2005, but Senegal has refused four extradition
requests.</p>
            <p>Plans in 2011 to repatriate Mr Habre to Chad, where a court in
2008 sentenced him to death in absentia for planning to overthrow
the government, were stopped following a plea from the UN.</p>
            <p>A trial in Senegal would set a historic precedent as until now
African leaders accused of atrocities have only been tried in
international courts.</p>
