            <p class="introduction">At least 16 people
have been killed in a series of bombings that struck crowded cafes
in and around the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, officials say.</p>
            <p>The bombs went off on Thursday evening when the coffee shops
were filled with people watching a football match.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, at least 10 people died when two suicide
bombers targeted a protest camp north of the capital.</p>
            <p>There has been a recent surge in sectarian violence in Iraq,
with last month the bloodiest since June 2008.</p>
            <p>Public places such as mosques, restaurants and local markets
have been singled out for attack.</p>
            <p>Two of Thursday's blasts went off at cafes in northern and
southern areas of Baghdad, where scores of young men had gathered
to watch football on television.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The attacks killed at least eight people, Reuters news agency
reports.</p>
            <p>Further explosions were also reported near coffee shops in
nearby towns south of the capital.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday, a spate of car bomb explosions in Baghdad claimed
more than 30 lives.</p>
            <p>Last month was Iraq's bloodiest since June 2008, with 1,045
civilians and security officials killed.</p>
            <p>Tensions between Iraq's Shia Muslim majority, which leads the
government, and minority Sunnis have been steadily growing since
last year.</p>
            <p>Sunnis have accused Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of
discriminating against them - a claim the government denies.</p>
