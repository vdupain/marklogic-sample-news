            <p class="introduction">Ben Elton's sitcom
The Wright Way has been cancelled after its first series, the BBC
has confirmed.</p>
            <p>Speaking at a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch, comedy
commissioner Shane Allen said the decision had been made "in
conjunction" with the comedian writer.</p>
            <p>The show, which stars The Thin Blue Line actor David Haig, was
heavily criticised in reviews and on Twitter.</p>
            <p>Allen said the show was a "valiant effort" but Elton had been
"bruised" by the reception.</p>
            <p>The writer, known for sitcom classics such as The Young Ones and
Blackadder, had <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19370732">previously
said</a> his "happiest memories" were from writing BBC comedy.</p>
            <p>The Wright Way, Elton's first BBC One sitcom since 2005's
Blessed, did not "catch fire with the audience" Allen admitted.</p>
            <p>"It wasn't what you could call a flop, over the course of a week
it had 3.5m to 4m viewers," he added.</p>
            <p>However, TV critics were not as kind with <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-reviews/wright-way-new-bbc-comedy-1856876">
The Mirror</a> calling it "the worst sitcom ever" and the Telegraph
said the show's debut episode <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10006788/The-Wright-Way-BBC-One-review.html">
"barely raises a smile"</a>.</p>
            <p>The BBC also announced today it has re-commissioned a second
series of Count Arthur Strong for BBC Two after its debut this
week.</p>
            <p>Written by comedians Steve Delaney and Graham Linehan, it stars
Delaney as the former variety show star alongside actor Rory
Kinnear.</p>
