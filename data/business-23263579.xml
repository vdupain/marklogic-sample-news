            <p class="introduction">Minutes of the
Federal Reserve's last policy meeting say officials want more
evidence of a jobs market recovery before winding up stimulus
measures.</p>
            <p>The minutes show that "about half" of the Fed's board felt the
$85bn-a-month stimulus programme could be phased out by the end of
2013.</p>
            <p>Speculation that the Fed might halt quantitative easing within a
couple of months had unnerved Wall Street.</p>
            <p>But the news that there would be no immediate exit sent US
markets higher.</p>
            <p>"Several members judged that a reduction in asset purchases
would likely soon be warranted," the minutes released on Wednesday
said.</p>
            <p>The minutes added that "many members indicated that further
improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required
before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset
purchases".</p>
            <p>In addition, most of the Fed's board said it should stick to its
ultra-low interest rate policy through to the end of 2015. However,
four members thought the benchmark rate could be increased this
year or next year.</p>
            <p>The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, underlined
his position on Wednesday during a question and answer session at
the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.</p>
            <p>He said that given the current unemployment rate in the US and
cutbacks in government spending "highly accommodative monetary
policy for the foreseeable future is what is needed for the US
economy".</p>
            <p>Since late last year, each month the Fed has been buying $85bn
in Treasury and mortgage bonds.</p>
            <p>The purchases have kept interest rates low, with the aim of
encouraging more Americans to buy homes and cars, and hopefully
bolster economic growth.</p>
            <p>Investors worry that once the Fed starts scaling back its bond
buying, interest rates will rise.</p>
            <p>In afternoon trading, after the minutes for the meeting in June
were released, the Dow Jones and S&amp;P began moving higher.</p>
            <p>Kim Rupert, a managing director at Action Economics, said it was
now more unclear when the Fed might run down its easy money
programme.</p>
            <p>"Most (analysts) had expected September might be a good starting
point. This throws a lot more doubt on that timeframe."</p>
