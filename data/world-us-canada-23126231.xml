            <p class="introduction">A performer in the
famous Cirque du Soleil has died after falling off a stage during a
show in Las Vegas.</p>
            <p>Paris-born Sarah Guyard-Guillot was performing in the Ka show at
the MGM Grand.</p>
            <p>The 31-year-old acrobat and mother of two was pronounced dead
late on Saturday night in hospital after falling 50ft (15m) from
the stage.</p>
            <p>Her death is believed to be the first fatality during a live
performance in the show's 30-year history.</p>
            <p>Witness Dan Mosqueda told the Las Vegas Sun that Ms
Guyard-Guillot was being hoisted up the side of the stage when it
appeared that she slipped free of her safety wire and plummeted to
an open pit below.</p>
            <p>"Initially, a lot of people in the audience thought it was part
of the [show]," he said.</p>
            <p>"But you could hear screaming, then groaning, and we could hear
a female artist crying from the stage."</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Sarah Guyard-Guillot (L) had performed
in the Ka show since 2006</span>
            </div>
            <p>The show was stopped and audience members told that refunds or
vouchers to future shows would be offered. All performances of Ka
have been cancelled until further notice.</p>
            <p>Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte issued a statement on
Sunday praising the performer, who has been with the original cast
since 2006 and has worked as an acrobat for 20 years.</p>
            <p>"I am heartbroken. I wish to extend my sincerest sympathies to
the family. We are reminded with great humility and respect how
extraordinary our artists are each and every night," he said.</p>
            <p>The Ka show combines dance, acrobatics and performance art with
pyrotechnics and complex aerial displays and is a resident show in
Las Vegas.</p>
            <p>Millions of people around the world go to see touring and
resident Cirque du Soleil shows every year.</p>
