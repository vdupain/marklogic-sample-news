            <p class="introduction">Nine members of one
of New York's five Italian organised crime families, the Bonannos,
have been arrested and accused of "old-school mob activity".</p>
            <p>Manhattan prosecutors announced the indictment on charges of
enterprise corruption on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>They say a $10 million scheme to run an organized criminal
enterprise had infiltrated a Long Island labour union.</p>
            <p>"Organized crime is by no means extinct," said Manhattan
District Attorney Cyrus Vance.</p>
            <p>"The <a href="http://manhattanda.org/press-release/district-attorney-vance-announces-indictment-captain-and-members-crew-bonanno-organize">
158-page indictment</a> demonstrates that organized crime is still
operating in New York City and has its hooks into the labour
movement,'' he added.</p>
            <p>A two-year investigation led to the dismantling of a Bonannos
family gang, which included suspected leader Nicholas "Nicky Mouth"
Santora, 71, who is already serving a two-year jail term in a
separate mob case.</p>
            <p>One of the Bonanno associates arrested was the head of Teamsters
917 on Long Island - a union representing about 1,900 workers in
liquor, automotive, parking and other industries.</p>
            <p>The indictment accuses Nicholas Bernhard of abusing his position
of power by soliciting union members as clients of criminal
activities.</p>
            <p>"This crew's use of a union president in its corrupt activities
is detrimental to honest union workers everywhere," it reads.</p>
            <p>In addition to extortion, loan sharking and gambling, the gang
is accused of trading prescription drugs including Viagra.</p>
            <p>Seven of the accused have pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>
            <p>Former Bonanno boss Joseph Massino became the highest-ranked
member of New York's Italian organized crime network to take to the
witness stand after his conviction for murder and racketeering in
2004.</p>
            <p>He later testified at the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13623497">trial</a> of
Vincent "Vinny Gorgeous" Basciano, who was accused of arranging the
killing of an associate and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
