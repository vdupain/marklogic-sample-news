            <p class="introduction">More than 1,000
children suspected of under-age drinking were arrested in Kenya's
capital Nairobi over the weekend, police say.</p>
            <p>Bars and clubs were raided after complaints that they had become
crowded with schoolchildren during a three-week teachers'
strike.</p>
            <p>Most of the children were later released because there were not
enough cells to hold them, police said.</p>
            <p>Teachers are on a nationwide strike to demand better pay.</p>
            <p>The Secretary General of the Kenya National Association of
Parents, Musau Ndunda, said it was sad that children spent their
time in bars and clubs instead of school.</p>
            <p>"But it is the government which should be
blamed for not being keen to resolve the teachers strike," he
said.</p>
            <p>"Instead of playing politics, why not pay the teachers and they
will go back to class and our children will definitely stream back
to school."</p>
            <p>Nairobi central police chief Patrick Oduma said the raids were
carried out to put a stop to young boys converging on "reggae music
discotheques".</p>
            <p>"To our surprise we found there is a very big number of
under-age children [drinking]," he said.</p>
            <p>"We have arrested the bar operators although we are yet to get
the owners."</p>
            <p>Mr Oduma said 116 of the children have been kept in custody.</p>
            <p>The rest were released because police cells were full, he
added.</p>
            <p>The detained children laughed and shouted as they were taken in
a police lorry to court, the BBC's Emmanuel Igunza reports from the
scene.</p>
            <p>Dozens of parents, mainly women, had gathered to hear the fate
of their children, he says.</p>
            <p>Teachers are demanding a pay increase from a deal with the
government that dates back to 1997.</p>
            <p>The deal would cost the government $540m
(Ã‚Â£362m) in increased allowances for
teachers and a further $175m to hire new teachers.</p>
            <p>The government says it cannot afford to meet the demands.</p>
