            <p class="introduction">As cybersecurity
becomes a bigger threat for American government and businesses,
high school and college students are being recruited early to help
fill vacant technical positions. In Virginia, these students
compete against one another for top slots.</p>
            <p>The attack started a little after 08:00.</p>
            <p>Numbers streamed across the computer screens in cryptic order,
containing disguised codes that could make the whole system
collapse. The mission: find the intruding language, isolate it, and
keep the system safe.</p>
            <p>In the basement, about 80 young adults, mostly in their late
teens and 20s, sat in silence, hunched over laptops, exchanging
only a few words of strategy and nods of approval.</p>
            <p>As the offensive got underway the sound of hundreds of fingers
tapping on keyboards were drowned out by the thumping bass of
Swedish House Mafia, blasted from the speakers in the corner.</p>
            <p>The battle was the final leg of a four-day cyber camp, hosted by
the US Cyber Challenge and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University.</p>
            <p>As part of the camp, a dozen teams raced against each other in a
so-called "capture the flag" competition. In this case, flags are
strings of information on websites that don't belong there. Teams
score points depending on the difficulty of isolating the rogue
data. From the sidelines, future employers watch, waiting to be
impressed.</p>
            <p>American corporations and government
entities face cyber-attacks every day, and are in dire need of
people to defend them. These college students may be the country's
best hope.</p>
            <p>With the rest of country facing a 7.6% jobless rate, recruiters
assess that the national unemployment gap - the number of vacant
positions compared to the number of available candidates - in
cybersecurity could be as high as one million, with 10,000
vacancies in the state of Virginia alone.</p>
            <p>"The age of the cybersecurity workforce is generally over 40
years of age, and we need new talent," says Samuel Schneider,
representative of (ISC)2, a global IT security organisation.</p>
            <p>Private contractors and government agencies like the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security use the
cyber camp to scout for that talent. A student with the right
skills can pretty much pick and choose a career.</p>
            <p>"Personally, I'm looking at the intelligence community and
government," says Jonathan Weber, 22, a student of computer
security at East Stroudsburg University, Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>The camp is also a way to introduce potential careers to those
with the skills, but without the knowledge of where those skills
can take them.</p>
            <p>"After coming to this camp, there's so many ways to branch out.
I've discovered a lot of options," says Nicholette Fortune, 19,
from Brooklyn, New York, and one of the few women among the
contestants. "I haven't had hands-on experience, so this is great
for a first time," she says.</p>
            <p>Academic institutions have beefed up efforts to meet the need
for cyber professionals, but the demand is still much greater than
the supply, says Diane Miller. She directs Cyber Patriot, a
high-school cyber competition hosted by the defence technology
contractor Northrop Grumman and the Air Force Association.</p>
            <p>By designating select institutes "centres of excellence" and
awarding scholarships to students, government agencies and private
contractors work with academia to try to keep America at the
cutting edge of the business.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Hacking contests have become an
international phenomenon, like this one held in France</span>
            </div>
            <p>"Everybody is scrambling to find that exceptional talent," says
Ms Miller. In June, Northrop Grumman launched a cyber-education
programme for kids in their early teens. The programme started in
Los Angeles, with plans to expand to the entire country.</p>
            <p>"The earlier we reach them, the less risk they are at, you know,
going out and performing illegal or illicit activities," says Mr
Schneider of (ISC)2. He says he is looking to "indoctrinate or
incorporate a new security mentality into children".</p>
            <p>Instead, potential lawbreakers can put their talents into good
use in national interest. "They are going to get into the system,
whether you like or not," says Mr Schneider.</p>
            <p>During the competition, participants use methods of attack,
which could easily be used for malicious intent. And that's the
point.</p>
            <p>"You have to know how to break things to be able to build them
really well," says Gary McGraw, a renowned security expert. McGraw
serves as chief technology officer for the software security
consulting firm Cigital, which he says grew 25% last year, and
constantly has vacancies equalling 10% of its workforce.</p>
            <p>He is not worried about teaching young
people techniques that could potentially be misappropriated. Like
other companies, Cigital insists it performs rigorous checks on a
potential employee's background and ethical conduct.</p>
            <p>And once in, Mr McGraw says, employees get a training that is
far superior to that of the "script kiddies" - his name for those
who attempt rogue attacks on Cigital's clients.</p>
            <p>The issue of employee reliability has gained new importance in
the past month thanks to former defence contractor Edward Snowden,
who claims to have sought employment with the technology firm Booz
Allen Hamilton in order to leak classified NSA intelligence.</p>
            <p>Among the cyber campers, many condemn his actions outright, and
some even warn against turning Snowden into a hero.</p>
            <p>"It's added some glamour to the whole thing," says Charisse
Scott, 23, as the competition in Virginia wraps up. "My worry is
that kids are going to be like, 'That's what I want to do'."</p>
            <p>However, in the basement in Virginia, all prestige and glamour
falls on Team 3, which wins the competition after taking an early
lead. The young adults behind their laptops are - at least for now
- more concerned about preventing security breaches than causing
them.</p>

            <h2>The Snowden effect</h2>
            <p>Edward Snowden, the private contractor who leaked classified
government documents, is a divisive figure within the cyber
security community. Many would not discuss him at all.</p>
            <p>"Is the system broken, is that what you're asking? Then my
answer is a resounding yes," says a government agency official who
asked to remain anonymous.</p>
            <p>Snowden is not the only person discontent with security measures
in general, this official says, and he was an example of resorting
to vigilante methods.</p>
            <p>Others have empathy for Snowden.</p>
            <p>"I think the [National Security Agency] was doing stuff that
they shouldn't have been doing, and that made Snowden really upset.
So it's a question of ethics in the organization," says Cigital's
Gary McGraw.</p>
            <p>"As an American citizen, I do not appreciate a nanny state where
my email headers are being collected."</p>

            <h2>Are geeks the new jocks?</h2>
            <p>As cybersecurity becomes more important to the global economy,
those who show aptitude at a young age might start to get the type
of treatment usually reserved for a star quarterback.</p>
            <p>Government institutions like the National Security Agency (NSA)
are awarding a growing number of scholarships to students looking
to work in cyber security, not unlike the way athletic skills have
traditionally opened doors to academic institutions.</p>
            <p>And the competitive aspect of cyber security on display at the
cyber camp has familiar roots, says Randy C Marchany, IT security
officer at Virginia Tech, who coaches volleyball on the side.</p>
            <p>"How do we identify people with cyber skills? Well, the sports
model is a model that works," he says.</p>
