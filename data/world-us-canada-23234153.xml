the White House called for "maximum restraint"</p>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The White House has
refused to describe Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi's removal as
a coup, saying that term carries "significant consequences".</p>
            <p>Spokesman Jay Carney said the US needed to "review what has
taken place" and monitor efforts to "forge an inclusive and
democratic way forward".</p>
            <p>Mr Carney said the US was not taking sides, and dismissed
suggestions the US would now cut off foreign aid to Egypt.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi was removed from office by the military amid
nation-wide protests.</p>
            <p>Mr Carney's remarks came as at least 51 people, including Morsi
supporters, were killed in violence in Cairo on Monday.</p>
            <p>At the White House, Mr Carney refused to characterise the events
of the past week in Egypt in any way, calling the political
upheaval there "an incredibly complex and difficult situation".</p>
            <p>The US government is barred by law from
giving foreign aid to countries under military coup.</p>
            <p>"There are significant consequences that go along with this
determination," Mr Carney said, "and it is a highly charged issue
for millions of Egyptians who have different views about what
happened."</p>
            <p>He said the US condemned violent attacks and incitements to
violence.</p>
            <p>"We remain actively engaged with all sides and we are committed
to supporting the Egyptian people as they seek to salvage their
nascent democracy," he said.</p>
            <p>"But we have been clear that these decisions belong to
Egyptians."</p>
            <p>Asked whether the US government was weighing cutting off its
estimated $1.5bn (Ã‚Â£1bn) in annual aid to
Egypt, Mr Carney said the Obama administration believed it "would
not be in the best interests of the United States to immediately
change our assistance programs to Egypt" but said it would continue
to monitor the situation.</p>
            <p>Republican Senator John McCain, a prominent voice on foreign
policy, called for a suspension of US aid but stopped short of
saying Mr Morsi should return to power.</p>
            <p>"Current US law is very clear about the implications for our
foreign assistance in the aftermath of a military coup against an
elected government," Mr McCain said. "I do not want to suspend our
critical assistance to Egypt, but I believe that is the right thing
to do at this time."</p>
            <p>The senator also said the Muslim Brotherhood, the movement to
which Mr Morsi belongs, should withdraw calls for a national
uprising, and said the Egyptian army should protect Mr Morsi and
his supporters from reprisals.</p>
