               <span style="width:224px;">Jill Meagher was originally from Drogheda, County
Louth</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Australian Adrian
Bayley has been jailed for the rape and murder of Irish woman Jill
Meagher.</p>
            <p>Bayley, who had pleaded guilty, was sentenced to life
imprisonment with a minimum jail term of 35 years.</p>
            <p>Ms Meagher, originally from County Louth, was attacked in
Melbourne last September as she walked home.</p>
            <p>The judge described Bayley as a "recidivist sex offender".
Bayley was on parole for previous rape convictions when he attacked
Ms Meagher.</p>
            <p>The case has led to criticism of the parole system in
Australia's Victoria state.</p>
            <p>In an earlier hearing, the court was told that Bayley had a
history of violent sex attacks.</p>
            <p>Judge Geoffrey Nettle said Bayley's rape of Ms Meagher was
"savage and degrading".</p>
            <p>"This is a recidivist, violent sex offender who intended to kill
and this killing is amongst the worst of its kind," he said.</p>
            <p>However, he said that Bayley's guilty plea had to be taken into
consideration in the sentence.</p>
            <p>"As bad as your crimes are, you will have the opportunity in
jail to strive for rehabilitation and I propose to set a non-parole
period as an incentive for you to try."</p>
            <p>In a statement, Ms Meagher's family said: "This despicable crime
against Gillian has happened and it has taken nine months to get
resolved and to get justice."</p>
            <p>"The police and prosecutors have ensured that justice has been
done and we as a family want to thank them for this."</p>
            <p>Ms Meagher's husband, Tom, said in a statement last week that
his life would "never be normal again".</p>
            <p>"I miss her insight, fun and wit, her huge smile and infectious
personality," he said.</p>
            <p>Ms Meagher, who was originally from Drogheda, moved to Australia
from Ireland in 2009 with her husband.</p>
            <p>She worked for ABC Radio but went missing during a night out
with colleagues.</p>
            <p>Her body was discovered six days later buried on the outskirts
of the city.</p>
            <p>News of her death prompted thousands to take part in a rally
against violence against women.</p>
