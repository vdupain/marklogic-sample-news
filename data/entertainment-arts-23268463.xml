Skyfall</span>

            <p class="introduction">Skyfall director Sam
Mendes is to direct the 24th James Bond film, due for release in
2015, it has been announced.</p>
            <p>Daniel Craig will reprise his role as the British spy, with the
script penned by Oscar winner, John Logan.</p>
            <p>Producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said: "We're
really excited to be working once again with Daniel Craig, Sam
Mendes and John Logan."</p>
            <p>Bond 24 is due for release in the UK on 23 October 2015.</p>
            <p>It will have its US release two weeks later, on 6 November.</p>
            <p>Mendes, who directed the recently-opened West End musical
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, said he was "very much looking
forward to taking up the reins again, and to working with Daniel
Craig, Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for a second
time".</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Daniel Craig will once again take on the
legendary role of James Bond</span>
            </div>
            <p>He added: "I am very pleased that by giving me the time I need
to honour all my theatre commitments, the producers have made it
possible for me to direct Bond 24."</p>
            <p>Skyfall made $1.1bn (Ã‚Â£700m) at the
worldwide box office. It was also the highest-grossing film of all
time in the UK, earning more than Ã‚Â£94m from
ticket sales in 40 days to beat the previous record holder Avatar,
which made Ã‚Â£94m in 11 months.</p>
            <p>Skyfall won two Oscars - singer Adele's theme song of the same
name won best original song and there was an award for sound
editing.</p>
            <p>It was also named the outstanding British film by Bafta.</p>
            <p>It was reported in May that Mendes had <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22700298">resumed
talks</a> with producers about directing the next Bond film, having
previously ruled himself out due to other commitments.</p>
            <p>Mendes is due to follow Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by
directing Shakespeare's King Lear at the National Theatre in
January 2014.</p>
            <p>The last film-maker to lead consecutive Bond movies was former
editor John Glen, who directed five films in a row between 1981 to
1989.</p>
