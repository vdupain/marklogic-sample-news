            <p class="introduction">The pound has fallen
sharply after the Bank of England warned that markets were wrong to
assume that it would start raising interest rates soon.</p>
            <p>Sterling immediately dropped a cent and a half against the
dollar to $1.5141.</p>
            <p>It came as the Bank held interest rates at 0.5% and kept its
quantitative easing programme (QE) unchanged.</p>
            <p>The decisions were made at the first meeting of the Bank's
Monetary Policy Committee since Mark Carney took over as governor
from Sir Mervyn King.</p>
            <p>Share prices rallied in London in anticipation of the further
continuation of cheap borrowing costs.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index jumped 50 points on the news, and later
gained a further lift from a promise by the European Central Bank
to keep eurozone rates low, taking it to 3% up for the day.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2013/007.aspx">
The unusual statement by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC)</a> comes as the economy shows signs of recovery, with
several industry surveys pointing to rising business optimism.</p>
            <p>Earlier on Thursday the Halifax reported that house prices
across the UK were 3.7% higher in the three months to June than a
year ago, adding to evidence that the property market is on the
rebound, particularly in the South East.</p>
            <p>The MPC said that the recovery "remains weak by historical
standards and a degree of slack is expected to persist for some
time".</p>
            <p>The positive developments in the economy have also been tempered
by a sharp rise on global markets in the long-term cost of
borrowing - something that has caught central banks worldwide by
surprise.</p>
            <p>In light of the market movements, "the implied rise in the
expected future path of Bank Rate was not warranted by the recent
developments in the domestic economy," the MPC said.</p>

            <p>The Bank has held short-term interest
rates at their current historic low level since March 2009.</p>
            <p>However, last month markets brought forward their expectations
for when interest rates in the UK - as well as in the US and other
major economies - would start rising again.</p>
            <p>It came after a statement from the US Federal Reserve laying out
a timetable for withdrawing its own QE programme was <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/2013/06/28/how-the-fed-lost-control-of-short-term-interest-rates/">
taken as a signal by markets that the era of cheap money was coming
to an end</a>, and sent stock markets, commodity and bond prices
lower worldwide.</p>
            <p>The Bank's statement immediately scaled back those expectations
in the sterling money markets.</p>
            <p>Even so, the Bank is still expected by markets to raise interest
rates by a quarter-point within the next 12 months. Back in April,
markets did not expect any change in monetary policy over the
coming year or more.</p>
            <p>With interest rates expected to remain low for longer, the pound
became less attractive on currency markets, sending sterling
lower.</p>
            <p>The pound also fell sharply against the euro, before rebounding
an hour and a half later as the European Central Bank committed to
maintaining its interest rates at or below their current level for
an "extended period of time", sending the euro lower against all
currencies.</p>
            <p>The Bank of England's move may also herald a change in style
with the change of governor.</p>
            <p>Mark Carney, who has just taken over, is
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23145755">known from
his time heading Canada's central bank for favouring "forward
guidance"</a> - providing markets with explicit statements about
the Bank's future plans, in order to manipulate longer-term
interest rates.</p>
            <p>The MPC has been asked by the Chancellor George Osborne to make
the case for forward guidance in a report to be delivered alongside
the August inflation report.</p>
            <p>The Bank said the analysis "would have an important bearing on
the committee's policy discussions in August".</p>
            <p>"This is close to the MPC issuing forward guidance in July,
instead of waiting until August," said David Tinsley, UK economist
at BNP Paribas.</p>
            <p>"It is clear from the statement that they are looking to forward
guidance as a key tool in massaging yields and expected Bank Rate
lower.</p>
            <p>"It is newsworthy in itself that despite better data, the
committee as a whole agreed this common view. It suggests at this
early stage that Mr Carney is both dovish leaning and very much in
charge."</p>
            <p>Although the no change in policy was widely anticipated by
markets, there is likely to be keener market interest than usual in
the voting pattern at Thursday's meeting, when minutes are
published on 17 July.</p>
            <p>The MPC has been split in recent months over whether to increase
QE from its current level of Ã‚Â£375bn, and
the outgoing governor, Sir Mervyn, was among the minority voting in
favour of an increase.</p>
            <p>It is unclear which way Mr Carney is likely to have voted on the
issue, particularly in light of the stronger economic recovery, as
well as the recent market jitters over future interest rates.</p>
            <p>Further complicating the picture, inflation in the UK remains
doggedly high - consumer prices rose 2.7% in May, well above the
Bank's 2% target.</p>
            <p>Inflation has been above target since 2009, and has been stuck
in the 2%-3% range for the past year, having previously fallen from
5%.</p>
            <p>The Bank has thus far turned a blind eye to the inflation
overshoot - something that is not expected to change under Mr
Carney.</p>
            <p>Wage rises have consistently failed to keep up with rising shop
prices, and this has undermined the purchasing power of households
and dampened consumer spending.</p>
