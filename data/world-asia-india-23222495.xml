            <p class="introduction">Federal
investigators in India have detained a man in connection with the
series of blasts on Sunday at India's holiest Buddhist shrine.</p>
            <p>Two people were injured in nine explosions at the Bodh Gaya
temple complex in Bihar state.</p>
            <p>Junior home minister RPN Singh said the blasts "seem like a
terror attack". No group has said it was responsible.</p>
            <p>The world-famous temple is a Unesco World Heritage Site visited
by thousands of pilgrims each year.</p>
            <p>"One suspect hailing from Barachatti area in Gaya district has
been detained and we are questioning him," Press Trust of India
quoted senior police officer Nayyer Hasnain Khan as saying on
Monday.</p>
            <p>Police said they were analysing the security camera footage from
the temple which showed two men who appeared to be planting
explosives at the site.</p>
            <p>Four blasts took place inside the temple complex, three in a
neighbouring monastery, and one each near a Buddha statue and a bus
stand, Bihar police officials said on Sunday.</p>
            <p>"I had been meditating for 10 minutes when there was a loud
sound. My face and my hand hurt as I tried to make my way to the
gate," Vilsagga, a student monk who was injured in the attack, told
The Hindu newspaper.</p>
            <p>A small cylinder containing explosives has been found under the
Bodhi tree, thought to be a descendant of the one that the Buddha
sat under when he achieved enlightenment, according to
tradition.</p>
            <p>Police said there was no damage to the tree.</p>
            <p>India's government has sent out an alert to eight cities,
including the capital, Delhi, to secure local Buddhist shrines and
places of worship, reports say.</p>
            <p>Bihar's Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said the blasts "deserve
strongest condemnation in strongest possible words as the
perpetrators targeted the place of religious faith of people with
an aim to create fear among them".</p>
            <p>Correspondents say attacks on Buddhists are rare in India, but
there have been recent Muslim-Buddhist tensions in nearby Burma
(also known as Myanmar), Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.</p>
