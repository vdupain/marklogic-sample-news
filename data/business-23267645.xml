cash into the economy</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The Bank of Japan
(BoJ) has said the country's economy is "starting to recover
modestly".</p>
            <p>The upbeat assessment of the economy came as the BoJ left its
huge monetary easing programme unchanged.</p>
            <p>It is the first time the BoJ has described the world's
third-largest economy as being on the path towards expansion in
more than two years.</p>
            <p>The bank is to stick to its plan of pumping more than 60tn yen
($606bn; Ã‚Â£402bn) a year into the
economy.</p>
            <p>The programme is known as "Abenomics'' after Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe, who took office late last year.</p>
            <p>The BoJ has been flagging up steady improvements in the economy
for the past six months, but Thursday's announcement is the first
to point to a broad recovery.</p>
            <p>"With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to
recover moderately on the back of the resilience in domestic demand
and the pick-up in overseas economies," the BoJ said in a
statement.</p>
            <p>Mr Abe appointed Haruhiko Kuroda, a veteran of international
finance, as the governor of the BoJ in March with a promise to
generate 2% inflation in two years.</p>
            <p>Japan has been suffering from deflation for some years.</p>
            <p>Economists are divided over the merits of "Abenomics", which is
short on details of how Japan's massive public debts will be
tackled or how certain industries will be made more
competitive.</p>
            <p>An election in the Japanese parliament's upper house set for 21
July is expected to serve as a litmus test for the public's
approval of the policies, which have already sent the share prices
higher and the yen lower in a big plus for exporters.</p>
