targeting suspected militants</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Suspected Islamist
militants in north-east Nigeria have killed at least nine school
children, the second targeted attack on students in recent
days.</p>
            <p>Gunmen believed to be from the Boko Haram group opened fire on
the pupils, who were in school uniform, at a school on the
outskirts of Maiduguri.</p>
            <p>Boko Haram said the attack was to punish youngsters for helping
the army.</p>
            <p>Some survivors said it was a response to the emergence of
vigilante groups in the town.</p>
            <p>North-eastern Nigeria is under a state of emergency as the
government tries to defeat an Islamist insurgency.</p>
            <p>Witness Ibrahim Mohammed said he was taking exams in a classroom
at Ansarudeen School when gunmen stormed the building.</p>
            <p>"I saw five students sitting the exams killed on the spot," he
said.</p>
            <p>"Four others were killed as they were entering the school
premises."</p>
            <p>Hospital workers confirmed that the bodies of nine children,
still in their uniforms, had been taken to the mortuary in
Maiduguri.</p>
            <p>A spokesman for Boko Haram handed a message to local journalists
saying that the attack was to punish youngsters for assisting the
army.</p>

            <p>The BBC's Will Ross in Lagos says vigilante groups have been
springing up in Maiduguri with young men wielding metal pipes,
clubs and machetes handing suspected militants over to the
army.</p>
            <p>A military spokesman said all those handed over would be given a
fair hearing.</p>
            <p>However, with hundreds of people being held in detention and few
ever coming to court, there is a danger that the vigilante groups
could be used to settle scores, our correspondent says.</p>
            <p>On Sunday, a school in Damaturu was attacked by suspected Boko
Haram gunmen and 13 people including students and teachers were
killed.</p>
            <p>Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan imposed a state of
emergency on north-east Nigeria last month and thousands more
troops were sent to fight the Islamist militants.</p>
            <p>So far there is no evidence to suggest that large numbers of
Boko Haram fighters have been killed, our correspondent adds.</p>
