            <p class="introduction">Tens of thousands of dead fish have washed
up on the banks of a Mexican reservoir, amid allegations that a
local firm contaminated the water.</p>
            <p>Local Mayor Emeterio Corona said the firm had dumped hundreds of
litres of molasses into a canal that flows into the reservoir in
Jalisco state.</p>
            <p>The fish had been starved of oxygen and died from asphyxiation,
he said.</p>
            <p>Local fishermen warned that their livelihoods had been put at
risk by the disaster.</p>
            <p>Some 180 families were reported to live off fishing on the
reservoir. Images from the scene showed piles of carp and sea bream
being gathered by local fishermen.</p>
            <p>Mr Corona, mayor of Acatlan de Juarez, did not name the firm
involved but said they had acted illegally.</p>
            <p>"The environment and the sustenance of everybody [in the
community] was damaged," he said.</p>
            <p>"What will they live off? I'm outraged. This is a tragedy."</p>
