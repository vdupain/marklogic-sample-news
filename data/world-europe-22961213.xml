            <p class="introduction">An Italian court has
sentenced to life in jail a man who carried out a school bomb
attack in 2012, which killed a teenage girl and injured nine
others.</p>
            <p>Giovanni Vantaggiato, 69, was convicted by the court in the
southern city of Brindisi, where the attack took place.</p>
            <p>Prosecutor Cataldo Motta said Vantaggiato had wanted to
"intimidate his country".</p>
            <p>The attack on 19 May 2012 - which killed 16-year-old Melissa
Bassi - sent shockwaves across Italy.</p>
            <p>Vantaggiato admitted carrying out the bombing, without giving a
motive.</p>
            <p>However, he is believed to have been in financial difficulties
at the time.</p>
            <p>The bomb, placed in a waste bin, exploded as students were
arriving for morning classes at the Morivllo Falcone school.</p>
            <p>Melissa Bassi was killed and nine other people were injured,
some seriously.</p>
            <p>Television footage of the scene later showed a concrete wall
blackened by fire next to the school's entrance gate, while broken
glass and other debris litter the pavement.</p>
            <p>The school is named after Judge Francesca Morvillo Falcone, a
victim of a notorious Mafia bombing in Sicily nearly 20 years
ago.</p>
            <p>She was killed along with her husband, anti-Mafia judge Giovanni
Falcone, on 23 May 1992.</p>
