            <p class="introduction">The skeleton of a New York state teacher
who vanished in 1985 has been discovered behind a false wall in the
home she shared with her late husband, police say.</p>
            <p>The remains of JoAnn Nichols were found in a foetal position,
tied with rope and wrapped in plastic at the house in the town of
Poughkeepsie.</p>
            <p>A post-mortem examination established she was killed by a blow
to her head.</p>
            <p>Her husband, James Nichols, died in December of natural causes
aged 82.</p>
            <p>County officials ordered the dead man's home to be cleared out
after no-one claimed his estate.</p>
            <p>On Friday, a contractor found the remains
of the missing primary school teacher, who was identified by her
dental records.</p>
            <p>Dutchess County medical examiner Kari Reiber said: "She was
struck in the head. It is being ruled a homicide."</p>
            <p>Nichols reportedly told detectives he last saw his 55-year-old
wife when he left for work at IBM in December 1985.</p>
            <p>The husband said he had found a typed note when he got home.</p>
            <p>At the time, a detective told the Poughkeepsie Journal newspaper
that the note had suggested a "degree of depression, but it's not
what I'd consider a suicide letter".</p>
            <p>Nichols later told the newspaper's reporter that his wife had
called him on Christmas Eve to tell him she was fine, although he
said she hung up when he asked where she was.</p>
            <p>Detective Paul Lecomte said on Tuesday of the husband: "We did
have some unanswered questions regarding him."</p>
            <p>When she vanished there was speculation Mrs Nichols may have
been depressed after the couple's only child drowned at the age of
25 three years earlier.</p>
