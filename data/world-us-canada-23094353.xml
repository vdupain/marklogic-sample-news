            <p class="introduction">A retired
high-ranking US general is under investigation for allegedly
leaking classified information about a covert cyber attack on
Iran's nuclear programme, US media report.</p>
            <p>Retired Marine General James "Hoss" Cartwright has been informed
by the Justice Department that he is a target in their inquiry, NBC
News reports.</p>
            <p>Gen Cartwright was vice-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
from 2007-11.</p>
            <p>The Stuxnet virus temporarily disabled Iranian nuclear
facilities in 2010.</p>
            <p>

The New York Times gave a detailed account last year</a> about the
virus, and how it temporarily took out nearly 1,000 centrifuges
that Iran was using to purify uranium.</p>
            <p>The newspaper said the attack was part of a wider cyber
operation called Olympic Games, that began under President George W
Bush and accelerated under President Barack Obama.</p>
            <p>The revelations prompted the US attorney to order an
investigation into the leaks.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/27/19174350-ex-pentagon-general-target-of-leak-investigation-sources-say?lite">
NBC News</a> quoted legal sources as saying that 63-year-old Gen
Cartwright had a received a letter from the Justice Department
informing him that he is a target in their investigation.</p>
            <p>A target is a suspect in a criminal case who has not yet been
formally charged but is expected to be, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-dept-targets-general-in-leak-probe/2013/06/27/9ad8bc4e-df7c-11e2-b2d4-ea6d8f477a01_story.html?hpid=z1">
the Washington Post reports</a>.</p>
            <p>Gen Cartwright was part of President Obama's inner circle of
security advisers before he retired in 2011.</p>
            <p>Both his lawyer and justice department officials have refused to
comment on the reports.</p>
