            <p class="introduction">A car bomb has
wounded dozens of people in a stronghold of Lebanon's Shia militant
group Hezbollah in Beirut.</p>
            <p>Lebanon's Health Minister Ali Hassan Khalil says 53 people were
hurt in the blast, in the Beir el-Abed area.</p>
            <p>No group has said it was behind the attack.</p>
            <p>Rebels in neighbouring Syria have threatened to target Hezbollah
in Lebanon, which intervened in the fighting over the border to
support President Bashar al-Assad.</p>
            <p>Two rockets hit south Beirut in May.</p>
            <p>Tuesday's explosion in the city's
southern suburbs took place in a car park near an Islamic centre;
no-one was in the car at the time.</p>
            <p>Dramatic footage broadcast by Hezbollah-run al-Manar TV showed
firefighters trying to put out the flames.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Dima Hamdan, reporting from the scene, described
considerable damage to nearby buildings. Many shops were forced to
close as their windows were shattered, she said.</p>
            <p>"Everyone started panicking. Everyone was running left and
right," local shopkeeper Carole Mansour told AFP news agency.</p>
            <p>"I can't believe someone would do this on the first day of
Ramadan," she added. Many Shia Muslims in Lebanon are beginning
their Ramadan fast on Tuesday, other Shia and Sunnis on Wednesday
or Thursday.</p>

            <p>Visiting the site of the blast, Lebanese
Interior Minister Marwan Charbel said the explosion was meant to
create a bigger schism between Sunni and Shia, but insisted that
would not happen.</p>
            <p>He was greeted by angry crowds, our correspondent says.</p>
            <p>"This is a message, but we will not bow," Hezbollah official
Ziad Waked told al-Manar, AP reports.</p>
            <p>A Hezbollah MP told the BBC that it was too early to speculate
on who was responsible for the bomb.</p>
            <p>Fighters from the militant group were instrumental in a
strategic victory by Syrian government forces in Qusair, close to
the border with Lebanon, in early June.</p>
            <p>Events in Syria are putting Lebanon's fragile peace in jeopardy,
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22968851">correspondents
say</a>, threatening the equilibrium which has held since the end
of the civil war over 20 years ago.</p>
