            <p class="introduction">A Chilean judge has
ordered that bone samples from the deceased Nobel prize-winning
poet Pablo Neruda be sent to Spain for fresh toxicology tests.</p>
            <p>Scientists in the US are also testing Mr Neruda's remains to
establish whether he was poisoned, as his former driver has
maintained for years.</p>
            <p>The left-wing poet died in 1973, days after the military coup
that brought General Augusto Pinochet to power.</p>
            <p>Initial findings seemed to support the official line that he
died of cancer.</p>
            <p>The results did not, however, rule out poisoning, requiring more
in-depth tests.</p>
            <p>A laboratory in the US state of North Carolina will analyse the
samples, while scientists at the university of Murcia, in Spain,
run parallel tests, a nephew of the poet, Rodolfo Reyes, said.</p>
            <p>The tests in Spain will be supervised by the Spanish expert
Aureliano Luna Maldonado, who also oversaw the exhumation of the
poet's remains in May.</p>
            <p>"It seems to us that every expert analysis which helps to
clarify Neruda's death is very important," Mr Reyes told Chile
newspaper El Mercurio.</p>
            <p>Initial tests appeared to confirm the official version of
events, that at the time of his death, Pablo Neruda was suffering
from advanced prostate cancer metastasis.</p>
            <p>But his former driver and personal assistant, Manuel Araya,
maintains that Mr Neruda was poisoned.</p>
            <p>Mr Araya says he called him from hospital, and told him he was
feeling sick after having been given an injection in the
stomach.</p>
            <p>The poet was a close friend of ousted Chilean President Salvador
Allende. He died aged 69, just 12 days after Gen Pinochet's
coup.</p>
            <p>Mr Neruda was buried next to his wife, Matilde Urrutia, in the
garden of their home on the Pacific coast of Chile in Isla Negra,
some 120km (75 miles) west of Santiago.</p>
            <p>In 2011, Chile started investigating Mr Araya's allegations.</p>
            <p>They are backed by the Chilean Communist Party, which says that
Neruda did not exhibit any of the symptoms associated with the
advanced cancer he is reported to have died of.</p>
            <p>They say the military government feared Neruda would go into
exile in Mexico and campaign against the Pinochet regime.</p>
