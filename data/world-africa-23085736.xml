            <p class="introduction">South Africans have
been holding an all-night prayer vigil for former President Nelson
Mandela, outside his former home in Soweto.</p>
            <p>The crowd have been singing and saying prayers for Mr Mandela's
health, on what is now his 20th night in hospital.</p>
            <p>South Africa's first black president - an icon of the
anti-apartheid struggle - is suffering from a lung infection.</p>
            <p>President Jacob Zuma said on Thursday that the 94-year-old's
condition had improved, but still remained critical.</p>
            <p>"He is much better today than he was when I saw him last night,"
<a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/pebble.asp?relid=15645">Mr
Zuma said</a> after speaking to Mr Mandela's medical team.</p>
            <p>Mr Zuma cancelled a visit to Mozambique to visit Mr Mandela in
hospital.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Mr Mandela's daughter Makaziwe said he was "still
there" and responding to touch.</p>
            <p>But she accused some journalists of being
like vultures, waiting for her father to die.</p>
            <p>Emotional crowds gathered outside the hospital, adding messages
of support for Mr Mandela, known by his clan name Madiba.</p>
            <p>Children released 94 balloons - one for every year of the
ex-president's life - into the air in his honour.</p>
            <p>Correspondents say South Africans now seem resigned to the
prospect of his death.</p>
            <p>"We don't like seeing Mandela going through so much pain, he has
had a tough time in his life and he's gone through a lot of
struggle. I think this struggle should get over sooner," Khulile
Mlondleni told Reuters news agency.</p>
            <p>"We are all going to feel bad when he passes [away], but at the
same time we will be celebrating his life. He has done so many
great things for this country," said 25-year-old John Ndlovu,
quoted by the agency.</p>
            <p>As crowds prayed in Soweto on Thursday evening, South Africa's
ruling African National Congress (ANC) said it would hold vigils
each day that the former leader remained in hospital.</p>
            <p>US President Barack Obama, who is in Senegal, described Mr
Mandela as "a hero for the world".</p>
            <p>"His legacy will linger on through the ages," he said.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>Speculation warning</strong>
            </p>
            <p>After visiting her grandfather in hospital on Wednesday, Ndileka
Mandela said it was an anxious time for the family.</p>
            <p>"He's stable and we'd like to say that we thank everybody for
giving their support and praying with us... we are anxious as you
know that he is critical but he's in a stable condition right now,"
she said.</p>
            <p>"It's been hard, especially because of
all of this - that we have to do everything in the public eye."</p>
            <p>Later Mr Mandela's daughter Makaziwe said that while the
situation was serious he was still responsive.</p>
            <p>"He doesn't look good, I'm not going to lie," she said, after
seeing him on Wednesday night.</p>
            <p>"But as I say, if we speak to him, he responds and tries to open
his eyes. He's still there. He might be waning off, but he's still
there," she told public broadcaster SABC.</p>
            <p>She was also highly critical of the behaviour of the
international media.</p>
            <p>"There is sort of a racist element with many of the foreign
national media where they cross boundaries - it's like truly
vultures waiting [for] when the lion has devoured the
buffaloÃ¢Â€Â¦ we don't mind the
interest but I just think that it has gone overboard," Ms Mandela
said.</p>
            <p>Mr Zuma's spokesman Mac Maharaj also criticised some media
outlets for broadcasting unverified information, as rumours spread
on social media sites.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile media reports say the bodies of three of Mr Mandela's
children are to be moved from his birthplace to his home in Qunu,
where he himself has said he wants to be buried.</p>
            <p>They include his son Makgatho, who died of an Aids-related
illness in 2005.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Mr Mandela is revered for leading the fight against white
minority rule in South Africa and then preaching reconciliation
despite being imprisoned for 27 years.</p>
            <p>He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and was elected
president the following year. He left office in 1999 after a single
term.</p>
            <p>Mr Mandela retired from public life in 2004 and has rarely been
seen at official events since.</p>
            <p>He has a long history of lung problems, and was diagnosed with
tuberculosis in the 1980s while he was a prisoner on Robben Island,
off Cape Town.</p>
            <p>After his release, Mr Mandela said that the tuberculosis was
probably caused by dampness in his prison cell.</p>

               <hr/>
            </div>
            <p>Nelson Mandela's eldest daughter Makiziwe's criticism has echoed
the sentiments of many South Africans who have baulked at the
"intrusive" nature of some of the media coverage around the former
president's state of health.</p>
            <p>One such report suggested that Mr Mandela had suffered cardiac
arrest on 8 June when he was rushed to hospital, and more recently
some unconfirmed media reports said the national icon was now on
life support. Some have described such details as "too much
information", others as "insensitive".</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the media continues to camp outside the heart hospital
in Pretoria where he is being treated, as well as outside his home
in Johannesburg, waiting for any news.</p>
            <p>This is particularly uncomfortable for traditional South
Africans, who see all the media attention as not only distasteful
but also going against African culture.</p>
            <p>There is a huge respect for death here and it is never mentioned
before the event.</p>
            <p>Even in this dark hour, very few speak frankly about the
94-year-old's passing - instead many are still praying for his
recovery.</p>
