               <span style="width:624px;">A scene from the National Theatre of
Scotland production of Let the Right One In</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The Royal Court
Theatre hopes a stage version of Swedish vampire love story Let the
Right One In will help it take a bite out of the teen market.</p>
            <p>Announcing her first season at the London venue, artistic
director Vicky Featherstone said she wanted to encourage teenagers
"to come to the theatre on their own, not as part of schools
groups".</p>
            <p>She hoped the offer of Ã‚Â£10 tickets for
under 26s would encourage teens to visit the theatre "instead of
going to the cinema".</p>
            <p>Let the Right One In had its world premiere at <a href="https://tickets.dundeerep.co.uk/public/">Dundee Rep</a> in
June.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/content/">National Theatre
of Scotland</a> production will open at the Royal Court in December
prior to a West End run.</p>
            <p>It tells the story of the relationship between Oskar, a lonely
bullied teenaged boy and Eli, a centuries-old vampire who befriends
him.</p>
            <p>The adaptation by Jack Thorne, based on
the novel and screenplay by John Ajvide Lindqvist, is described as
being "for adults and fearless teens aged 13+".</p>
            <p>Featherstone's new season, unveiled on Monday, includes new
plays by Abi Morgan and Dennis Kelly - both making their Royal
Court debuts - and a trilogy of Samuel Beckett shorts.</p>
            <p>Morgan's play, The Mistress Contract, is based on reams of tape
recordings that chart a decades-long affair between a real-life
couple who still live on the west coast of America. She is now 88.
He is 93.</p>
            <p>Having first met at university, they began an affair 20 years
later when he was a wealthy businessman and she was raising her
children "in a loveless marriage".</p>
            <p>The woman - described as highly educated and with "a history of
involvement in the feminist movement" - faxed her lover with a
contract offering "mistress services" in return for a home and an
income.</p>
            <p>The man signed it and sent it back. Part of the contract was
that she would tape record all of their encounters.</p>
            <p>Featherstone, who will direct the play next year, said: "At
every meeting, every dinner, every breakfast, during sex, she had
the tape recorder on - it charts a cultural journey of the last 40
years."</p>

               <span style="width:224px;">Vampire story: Rebecca Benson is
returning to the cast as Eli</span>
            </div>
            <p>Morgan's recent writing credits include The Iron Lady, which
starred Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher, and Steve McQueen's film
about sex addiction, Shame, as well as BBC TV series The Hour.</p>
            <p>Casting for the play - "a two-hander for two older actors" - is
yet to be announced.</p>
            <p>Before that, in September, Featherstone will direct "dark
morality tale" The Ritual Slaughter of Gorge Mastromas, by Dennis
Kelly, who co-wrote Matilda the Musical.</p>
            <p>The Royal Court follows its recent sell-out run of Beckett's
monologue <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22397436">Not I</a>
with a trilogy of short Beckett plays in the new year.</p>
            <p>Irish actress Lisa Dwan will again perform Not I alongside
Footfalls and Rockaby, directed by Beckett's long-time friend and
collaborator Walter Asmus, ahead of an international tour.</p>
            <p>Other plays in the new season will examine issues around Islam
and immigration.</p>
            <p>Featherstone took over at the Royal Court in May, having been
artistic director of the National Theatre of Scotland since
2006.</p>
            <p>Speaking to the BBC about her plans for Let the Right One In,
she said the play's run in Dundee had attracted a "wealth of
teenagers".</p>
            <p>"They also created a game and app around it and so the teenagers
really felt ownership of the piece of work," she said.</p>
            <p>She described teenagers as "our audiences of the future and also
our artists of the future".</p>
            <p>"It's about putting something on that they want to come to and
making sure that it's affordable," she said.</p>
            <p>The National Theatre of Scotland's award-winning military drama
Black Watch, she added, had attracted audiences where 60% were aged
under 20.</p>
            <p>Attracting younger audiences and first-time attendees through
discounted tickets has been a focus for many theatres in both the
subsidised and commercial sectors.</p>
            <p>The National Theatre's membership of Entry Pass, a discount
ticket scheme for 16 to 25-year-olds, now has more than 42,000
members.</p>
            <p>According to its <a href="http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/sites/all/libraries/files/documents/National-Theatre-Annual-Report-2011-2012.pdf">
annual report</a> last year, 33% of the National Theatre's audience
on the South Bank in 2011-12 were first-time bookers.</p>
            <p>Last year, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20640573">Michael
Grandage revealed</a> that many of the Ã‚Â£10
tickets for his West End season had been snapped up by "young
people". Ã¢Â€Âƒ</p>
