declining for the past few quarters</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Global personal
computer (PC) sales have fallen for the fifth quarter in a row,
making it the "longest duration of decline" in history.</p>
            <p>Worldwide PC shipments totalled 76 million units in the second
quarter, a 10.9% drop from a year earlier, according to research
firm Gartner.</p>
            <p>PC sales have been hurt in recent years by the growing
popularity of tablets.</p>
            <p>Gartner said the introduction of low-cost tablets had further
hurt PC sales, especially in emerging economies.</p>
            <p>"In emerging markets, inexpensive tablets have become the first
computing device for many people, who at best are deferring the
purchase of a PC," said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at
Gartner, <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2544115">said
in a statement</a>.</p>
            <p>Separate data released by research firm
IDC also showed an 11.4% decline in global PC shipments during the
period, from a year earlier.</p>
            <p>IDC, which uses a slightly different method to calculate the
data, <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24213513">said that
shipments totalled</a> 75.6 million units in the second
quarter.</p>
            <p>However, it said that the numbers were better than it had
expected and were likely to improve in the coming months.</p>
            <p>"With second quarter growth so close to forecast, we are still
looking for some improvement in growth during the second half of
the year," said Jay Chou, a senior analyst at IDC Worldwide PC
Tracker.</p>
            <p>But he warned that the sector was facing risks and much work
needed to be done to turn around things.</p>
            <p>"Slower growth in Europe and China reflect the risks, while the
improved US outlook reflects potential improvement. Still, the
weakness in emerging markets is a threat to a core long-term growth
area," Mr Chou said.</p>
            <p>"In addition, while efforts by the PC ecosystem to bring down
price points and embrace touch computing should make PCs more
attractive, a lot still needs to be done in launching attractive
products and addressing competition from devices like tablets."</p>
