            <p class="introduction">Illinois has become the last state in the
US to allow residents to carry concealed handguns, after lawmakers
overrode the governor's veto.</p>
            <p>Large majorities in the state House and Senate dismissed
objections by Democratic Governor Pat Quinn.</p>
            <p>The state had been under court order to adopt a concealed carry
law.</p>
            <p>The debate over gun rights in the US has raged since December,
when a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children, at a school
in Connecticut.</p>
            <p>Gun rights proponents say the US
constitution protects an individual's right to carry guns, while
opponents of the concealed carry law feared it would allow
virtually unregulated possession of handguns in the city of
Chicago, which is grappling with a severe gun violence
epidemic.</p>
            <p>In December, a federal appeals court struck down Illinois' ban
on carrying a concealed weapon as a violation of the US
constitution's guarantee of the right to bear arms. The court gave
the state six months to write a law legalising it.</p>
            <p>Mr Quinn vigorously opposed a concealed carry law, but the
Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal.</p>
            <p>In May, the state legislature passed a bill despite his
objections. He vetoed the bill, suggesting restrictions on
concealed weapons that would satisfy him.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday, legislators in the House and Senate easily mustered
a two-thirds majority needed to override Mr Quinn's veto, barely
beating the court deadline.</p>
            <p>"Following a weekend of horrific violence in Chicago in which at
least 70 people were shot and 12 killed, this was the wrong move
for public safety in Illinois," Mr Quinn said in a statement after
the vote.</p>
            <p>He said legislators had "surrendered" to the National Rifle
Association, a powerful gun rights lobby funded in part by weapons
manufacturers.</p>
            <p>He warned the new law would allow people to carry guns in pubs
and bars, and allow people to carry virtual arsenals on their
persons.</p>
            <p>Gun rights proponents, meanwhile, celebrated.</p>
            <p>"This is a historic, significant day for law-abiding gun
owners,'' Representative Brandon Harris, a southern Illinois
Democrat said, according to the Associated Press.</p>
            <p>Referring to the clause in the US constitution that refers to
gun ownership, he said, "They finally get to exercise their Second
Amendment rights."</p>
