payments</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A Spanish newspaper
has published what it alleges are documents showing Prime Minister
Mariano Rajoy and other top politicians received illicit
payments.</p>
            <p>El Mundo said it had original ledger entries handwritten by the
former treasurer of the governing Popular Party (PP), Luis
Barcenas.</p>
            <p>It said it had delivered the documents to the High Court.</p>
            <p>Mr Rajoy and other PP members have repeatedly denied that they
received illegal payments.</p>
            <p>Another Spanish paper, El Pais, published similar documents
earlier this year.</p>
            <p>It is claimed that Mr Barcenas ran a PP slush fund that took
donations from construction magnates and distributed them to party
leaders in cash.</p>
            <p>Mr Barcenas is in custody facing trial
for corruption and tax fraud. He denies the allegations.</p>
            <p>However, in an interview published in El Mundo on Sunday, Mr
Barcenas for the first time admitted that the handwriting in the
ledger was his.</p>
            <p>He added that the photocopies originally published by El Pais
were a fraction of the documents he had in his possession.</p>
            <p>El Mundo said the documents it had seen showed that Mr Rajoy
received payments in 1997, 1998 and 1999 when he was a minister in
the government of Jose Maria Aznar.</p>
            <p>They included, it said, two payments to Mr Rajoy of 2.1m pesetas
(12,600 euros; Ã‚Â£11,000) in 1998.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Luis Barcenas has been denied bail
pending his trial</span>
            </div>
            <p>The alleged payments are said to have been undeclared and
untaxed.</p>
            <p>Spanish opposition leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba in February
called on Mariano Rajoy to resign over the allegations.</p>
            <p>"The Luis Barcenas originals published by El Mundo today
pulverise the alibi used until now by the PP to deny the
authenticity of its ex-treasurer's papers," El Mundo said.</p>
            <p>The PP responded with a statement saying: "The Popular Party
reiterates that it does not know of the notes nor their content,
and it does not in any way recognise them as the accounts of this
political organisation."</p>
            <p>This is another twist in possibly the most important corruption
scandal to hit modern Spanish politics, says the BBC's Tom Burridge
in Madrid.</p>
            <p>The allegations have caused anger among Spaniards already
suffering a deep and long recession and biting austerity cuts.</p>
