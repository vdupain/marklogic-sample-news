            <p class="introduction">The death toll after
riots in China's far western region of Xinjiang has risen from 27
to 35, state media say.</p>
            <p>The rioters had attacked police stations with knives and set
fire to police cars on Wednesday, killing 24 people, reports
said.</p>
            <p>The police killed 11 of the attackers and captured four, the
report added.</p>
            <p>There are sporadic outbreaks of violence in Xinjiang, where
there are ethnic tensions between Muslim Uighur and Han Chinese
communities.</p>
            <p>State media have described the incident as a "terrorist attack",
but provided no information about the ethnicity of the rioters or
what sparked the incident.</p>
            <p>Confirming reports from the region is
difficult because information is tightly controlled.</p>
            <p>The violence occurred in Turpan's remote township of Lukqun,
about 200km (120 miles) south-east of the region's capital, Urumqi,
early on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>Sixteen of those killed by the rioters were from the Uighur
ethnic group, state-run news agency Xinhua said.</p>
            <p>Two police officers were amongst the victims, Xinhua added.</p>
            <p>Security has been stepped up, with foreign journalists being
denied access to Lukqun town.</p>
            <p>Uighurs make up about 45% of Xinjiang's population, but say an
influx of Han Chinese residents has marginalised their traditional
culture.</p>
            <p>Beijing authorities often blame violent incidents in Xinjiang on
Uighur extremists seeking autonomy for the region. Uighur
activists, meanwhile, accuse Beijing of over-exaggerating the
threat to justify heavy-handed rule.</p>
            <p>In 2009 almost 200 people - mostly Han Chinese - were killed
after deadly rioting erupted in Urumqi between the Han Chinese and
Uighur communities.</p>

            <p>When we approached the town of Lukqun we hit a checkpoint. The
area was swarming with armed police. Nobody - including us - was
getting through.</p>
            <p>Locals have been warned not to speak out. We were followed for
the whole day by officials in a black car.</p>
            <p>There has yet to be any official explanation as to what
triggered the violence. But some locals told us it was caused by a
religious dispute.</p>
            <p>It has echoes of a similar incident in Xinjiang this April in
which more than twenty died.</p>
            <p>Beijing blamed the violence on terrorists. But locals told the
BBC that the incident was triggered after officials prevented women
from one devout Muslim family from wearing full veils. It was
claimed they pressured the men to shave their beards.</p>
            <p>What is clear from recent events is the smouldering tensions
that exist on China's rugged western frontier.</p>
