            <p class="introduction">Reforms needed to
ensure free and fair presidential and parliamentary polls in
Zimbabwe later this month have not been introduced, says PM Morgan
Tsvangirai.</p>
            <p>He also pledged to create more jobs as he launched his campaign
at a rally in Marondera, ahead of the 31 July vote.</p>
            <p>He is standing for president against his main rival and
coalition partner, Robert Mugabe.</p>
            <p>On Friday Mr Mugabe said it was a "do or die struggle", but
urged supporters to refrain from violence.</p>
            <p>The 89-year-old president predicted a 90% victory for his
Zanu-PF party.</p>
            <p>There have been concerns about violence and intimidation ahead
of the vote.</p>
            <p>Mr Tsvangirai was approaching these elections "with a heavy
heart", since the necessary reforms had not been introduced, he
told the crowd.</p>

            <p>"There are no reforms in the media, and other reforms to ensure
free and fair elections have not been achieved," he told supporters
at the rally east of Harare.</p>
            <p>The leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) pledged
to create jobs and boost industries such as manufacturing and
mining that have seen businesses closed in recent times.</p>
            <p>He also promised to introduce free health care within the first
100 days of his presidency and to scrap maternity healthcare fees
for women.</p>
            <p>And the 61-year-old said he would only bring back the Zimbabwean
dollar if there was economic stability.</p>
            <p>He pulled out of the second round of the 2008 presidential
election, accusing the security forces and pro-Mugabe militias of
attacking his supporters around the country.</p>
            <p>He had won the most votes in the first round but, according to
official results, not enough to win outright.</p>
            <p>After Mr Mugabe went ahead with the run-off, winning with 85% of
votes cast, regional mediators intervened to organise the
power-sharing agreement.</p>
            <p>The election will mark the end of that coalition government,
which has stabilised the country's economy.</p>
            <p>On Thursday, the Constitutional Court rejected an appeal by both
parties to delay elections set for 31 July for a couple of
weeks.</p>
            <p>Critics says key security, media and electoral reforms demanded
by regional mediators, the Southern African Development Community
(Sadc), have yet to be implemented.</p>
            <p>The MDC also warned last month that the voters' roll was in a
"shambles" and the vote could be rigged.</p>
