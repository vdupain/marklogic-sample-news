should do "something for humanity" on Mr Mandela's

            <p class="introduction">South Africa's
President Jacob Zuma has told the nation to begin planning for
Nelson Mandela's birthday on 18 July.</p>
            <p>The former president and global statesman, who will turn 95,
remains critically ill in hospital in Pretoria.</p>
            <p>He was admitted on 8 June with a recurring lung infection.</p>
            <p>President Zuma's comments come after Mr Mandela's ex-wife
criticised his governing African National Congress (ANC) party for
filming the former president at his home in April.</p>
            <p>The footage showed Mr Mandela looking dazed and unsmiling during
a visit by one of the ANC's leaders to his home.</p>
            <p>Winnie Madikizela-Mandela <a href="http://www.itn.co.uk/World/79616/winnie-mandela--nobody-knows-nelson-mandela-better-than-i-do">
told ITV News</a>: "I honestly cannot put in words how hurt the
family was and it was one of the most insensitive things for anyone
to have done."</p>
            <p>Responding to criticism at the time, the ANC defended its filmed
visit, saying it was not a "publicity stunt".</p>
            <p>On Monday, President Zuma put out a statement reminding "all
South Africans to begin planning for Madiba's birthday", using the
former leader's clan name.</p>
            <p>"We must all be able to do something good for humanity on this
day, in tribute to our former president,'' he said.</p>
            <p>Mr Mandela is revered for leading the fight against white
minority rule in South Africa and then preaching reconciliation
despite being imprisoned for 27 years.</p>
            <p>He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and was elected
president the following year. He left office in 1999 after a single
term.</p>
            <p>Mr Mandela retired from public life in 2004 and has rarely been
seen at official events since.</p>
            <p>He has a long history of lung problems, and was diagnosed with
tuberculosis in the 1980s while he was a prisoner on Robben
Island.</p>
            <p>After his release, Mr Mandela said that the tuberculosis was
probably caused by dampness in his prison cell.</p>
