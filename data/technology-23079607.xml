               <span style="width:512px;">Social media has been widely used as a source of
information about protests</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The Turkish
government has asked Twitter to set up an office inside the country
so company representatives can be reached more easily.</p>
            <p>Both Twitter and Facebook were used to spread information during
recent anti-government protests.</p>
            <p>Several dozen tweeters were arrested following the protests,
according to local media reports.</p>
            <p>Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has previously
described Twitter as a "scourge".</p>
            <p>On Thursday, Transport and Communications Minister Binali
Yildrim said: "When information is requested, we want to see
someone in Turkey who can provide this.</p>
            <p>"There needs to be an interlocutor we can put our grievance to
and who can correct an error if there is one."</p>
            <p>Twitter declined to respond to the government request on
Wednesday, but a person familiar with the company said it had no
current plans to open an office in that country.</p>
            <p>Neither Twitter nor Facebook currently have an office in the
country, although Facebook has staff in London who deal
specifically with Turkey.</p>
            <p>Both are popular in the country and were widely used by citizens
seeking information about the protests at a time when mainstream
Turkish media provided little or no coverage of the events.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday Mr Yildrim said: "Facebook has been working in
coordination with the Turkish authorities for a long time... We
don't have any problem with them."</p>
            <p>It led to speculation that the social network had provided the
authorities with data on protesters, something the firm was quick
to deny.</p>
            <p>It said that it had not been asked by the Turkish government to
provide any users' data following the protests.</p>
            <p>It has closed down some pages related to activism in Turkey, but
only, it said, because they had had "fake profiles".</p>
            <p>"More generally, we reject all government data requests from
Turkish authorities and push them to formal legal channels unless
it appears that there is an immediate threat to life or a child,"
it said in a statement.</p>
            <p>Social networks and other technology firms are attempting to
rebuild trust with users following allegations that large amounts
of data was handed to the US National Security Agency under a
surveillance program known as Prism.</p>
