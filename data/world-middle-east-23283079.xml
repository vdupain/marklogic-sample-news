            <p class="introduction">A senior member of
the Free Syrian Army is reported to have been killed by a rival
rebel group linked to al-Qaeda.</p>
            <p>Kamal Hamami, of the group's Supreme Military Council, was
meeting members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant "to
discuss battle plans".</p>
            <p>A Free Syrian Army spokesman said he received a call from the
group saying they had killed Kamal Hamami.</p>
            <p>It is part of an escalating struggle within the armed uprising
between moderates and Islamists.</p>
            <p>The BBC's Paul Woods says a civil war within a civil war is
building within the opposition as the two sides engage in a battle
that is partly over the spoils and partly ideological.</p>
            <p>Mr Hamami, also known as Abu Bassel al-Ladkani, had been meeting
members of the Islamic State in the port city of Latakia "to
discuss battle plans", Free Syrian Army spokesman Qassem Saadeddine
said.</p>
            <p>"The Islamic State phoned me saying that they killed Abu Bassel
and that they will kill all of the Supreme Military Council," he
told Reuters news agency.</p>
            <p>The Free Syrian Army was formed in 2011 by army deserters based
in Turkey and is said to have some 40,000 members.</p>
            <p>Although they have had some successes in the fight against
President Assad's forces, they say they will be unable to win the
war unless they acquire more sophisticated weaponry.</p>
            <p>In recent months, Western and Arab nations have agreed to step
up support for moderate Syrian rebels in their battle against
President Bashar al-Assad's forces.</p>
            <p>But many in the West are nervous about heavy weaponry falling
into the hands of radical groups.</p>
            <p>Al-Qaeda in Iraq announced in April that it was merging with the
Syrian Islamist group Nusra Front to form the single Islamic State
of Iraq and al-Sham (the Levant).</p>
            <p>The leader of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has urged its
fighters to strive for an Islamic state in Syria.</p>
            <p>The spread of Sharia in rebel-held areas has alarmed the
moderate members of the opposition, who, though Muslim, do not want
a religious state.</p>
