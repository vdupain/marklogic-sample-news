slowing demand from key markets</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">China has reported a
slowdown in growth of its manufacturing sector, underlining
concerns that its economic recovery continues to remain
fragile.</p>
            <p>The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a key measure of
manufacturing activity, fell to a four-month low of 50.1 in June,
from 50.8 in May.</p>
            <p>A sub-index of new orders also fell, indicating a weak
demand.</p>
            <p>The manufacturing and export sectors have been key drivers of
China's economic growth in recent years.</p>
            <p>However, they have been under pressure lately amid a slowdown in
key export markets as well as China's own economic growth.</p>
            <p>"The June PMI fall, across the board on major sub-indexes,
indicates downward pressure in the economy," said Zhang Liqun, an
economist with the Development Research Centre, a top government
think tank.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile a separate report by HSBC, which surveys smaller
firms, said that manufacturing activity in the country fell to a
nine-month low.</p>
            <p>HSBC said its PMI for China fell to 48.2 in June, down from 49.2
in May.</p>
            <p>China's manufacturing and export sectors have been hurt by a
slowdown in key markets such as the US and eurozone.</p>
            <p>That has had a direct impact on its overall economic growth.</p>
            <p>China's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.7% in the first
three months of the year, down from 7.9% in the previous
quarter.</p>
            <p>As a result, there have been calls for China to reduce its
reliance on exports and boost domestic consumption to rebalance its
economy.</p>
            <p>For its part, Beijing has indicated that it wants to take steps
to boost domestic consumption. But there have been concerns that as
it shifts its growth model, it is likely to see a slowdown in
growth in the near term.</p>
            <p>Some analysts said that China's growth rate was likely to slow
further in the coming months.</p>
            <p>Zhiwei Zhang of Nomura said "there is a 30% chance" that China's
growth rate may drop below the 7% mark in the third or fourth
quarter.</p>
            <p>Last month, the World Bank cut its growth forecast for China,
saying that rebalancing efforts had slowed the world's
second-largest economy,</p>
            <p>The bank now expects China to grow 7.7% in 2013, down from its
earlier projection of 8.4%.</p>
