               <span style="width:624px;">The reformed national curriculum for
autumn 2014 is meant to be more stretching for pupils</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A revised national
curriculum for schools in England has been announced, with the aim
of catching up with the world's best education systems.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister David Cameron says this "revolution in education"
is vital for the country's economic prosperity.</p>
            <p>The changes will include fractions for five year olds and
teaching evolution in primary schools.</p>
            <p>Labour said the curriculum should be written by experts and not
depend on ministers' "personal prejudices".</p>
            <p>Teachers' unions have warned that the timetable for implementing
the changes in autumn 2014 is "completely unrealistic".</p>
            <p>Head teachers have also asked whether politicians should be so
directly involved in deciding what is taught in the classroom.</p>
            <p>The re-written national curriculum sets out the framework for
what children in England's state schools should be taught between
the ages of five and 14.</p>

            <p>However, academies - which are now a majority of secondary
schools - will not be required to follow the curriculum.</p>
            <p>"This is a curriculum that is rigorous, engaging and tough,"
said the prime minister.</p>
            <p>Education Secretary Michael Gove said the changes to the
curriculum were necessary to keep pace with the achievement of
pupils in other countries.</p>
            <p>"No national curriculum can be modernised without paying close
attention to what's been happening in education internationally,"
said Mr Gove.</p>
            <p>He cited Hong Kong, Massachusetts, Singapore and Finland as "the
world's most successful school systems".</p>
            <p>The new-look curriculum puts a stronger emphasis on skills such
as "essay writing, problem-solving, mathematical modelling and
computer programming".</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>The history curriculum</strong> proved controversial,
with an earlier version criticised for including too many lists of
facts and too little world history.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Maths</strong> will expect more at an earlier age.
There will be a requirement for pupils to learn their 12 times
table by the age of nine. Basic fractions, such as half or a
quarter, will be taught to five year olds.</li>
               <li>
                  <strong>English</strong> will strengthen the importance of
Shakespeare, with pupils between the ages of 11 and 14 expected to
have studied two of his plays. Word lists for 8 and 9 year olds
include "medicine" and "knowledge", by 10 and 11 they should be
spelling "accommodate" and "rhythm".</li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Science</strong> will shift towards a stronger sense of
hard facts and "scientific knowledge". In primary school, there
will be new content on the solar system, speed and evolution. In
secondary school, there will be a clearer sense of separate
subjects of physics, biology and chemistry. Climate change will
also be included.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Design and technology</strong> is linked to innovation
and digital industries. Pupils will learn about 3D printing and
robotics.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Computing</strong> is linked to the digital start-up
and apps culture, with pupils being taught coding and how to create
their own computer programs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Anthony Seldon, head master of Wellington College, welcomed the
idea of a more demanding curriculum, saying that "young people
shouldn't be patronised by work that is too easy".</p>
            <p>"Factual knowledge is essential," he said, providing the
"building blocks" for more advanced ideas in subjects in the
sciences, arts and humanities.</p>
            <p>He says it is important for all youngsters to learn a common
core of knowledge.</p>
            <p>"It can get too fluffy to say 'It's all on the internet,'" said
Dr Seldon.</p>
            <p>Conservative peer Baroness Pauline Perry, a former chief
inspector of schools in England, said she expected teachers would
be "excited" by the opportunity for creativity allowed by the new
curriculum.</p>
            <p>This included local history projects at every stage, science
experiments that pupils, rather than teachers, could conduct and
exciting projects in design and technology classes, she said.</p>
            <p>"We are going to produce a generation which is finally fitted
with the skills and the knowledge they need in order to get jobs -
we've failed them in the past," she told the BBC's Today
programme.</p>
            <p>Brian Lightman, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said
that heads shared the aspiration for high standards, but warned of
the practical problems of implementation.</p>
            <p>"One year to implement such ambitious
proposals effectively alongside the vast number of concurrent
reforms is a tall order."</p>
            <p>He also questioned the level of political involvement in the
process.</p>
            <p>"Drafting a curriculum is a highly specialised and professional
task. Unlike previous versions of the national curriculum, which
were drafted with a heavy involvement of teachers and school
leaders, these proposals have been driven and closely directed by
politicians without that professional input."</p>
            <p>He said the government needed to take "urgent steps" to include
head teachers in implementing the changes.</p>
            <p>Mary Bousted, leader of the ATL teachers' union, accused the
education secretary of wanting to "steamroller ahead" with rushed
changes.</p>
            <p>"The timescales to which he is operating are completely
unrealistic. He shows a fundamental lack of understanding of how
much planning is needed to bring in a totally new curriculum and
new exams for children in all age groups at the same time."</p>
            <p>She told the BBC's Today programme that she feared the new
curriculum would not be rigorous enough.</p>
            <p>"It will be a memory test and that is not what children and
young people need for the 21st Century when their lives and their
work will require skills of knowledge acquisition, understanding
and being able to implement the knowledge."</p>
            <p>Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: "David Cameron
and Michael Gove have spent the last three years trying to
personally rewrite the National Curriculum - they should have
listened to the experts in the first place.</p>
            <p>"They have had to go back and change the programmes of study for
design and technology, geography and history after experts warned
there were serious omissions and they were not suited to prepare
young people for the challenges of the modern world. It's right
that changes have been made to ICT and computing following concerns
raised by Labour and the ICT sector, but we await further
details.</p>
            <p>"Labour wants to ensure the national curriculum sets clear
expectations for the knowledge and skills children and young people
should reach by a certain age. This curriculum looks like more of
the same though."</p>
