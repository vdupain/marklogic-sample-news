            </div>
            <p class="introduction">US carmaker Chrysler
has said that it will recall nearly 840,000 vehicles.</p>
            <p>This includes 490,000 vehicles which may have a potentially
faulty component for head rests that are designed to move forward
during rear-end crashes.</p>
            <p>It is recalling 282,000 minivans to fix software which is
"inadvertently programmed" to deploy side airbags on the opposite
side to that of an impact.</p>
            <p>Chrysler said there had been three reported incidents and one
"minor" injury due to the airbag issue.</p>
            <p>However, it added that it was not aware of any incident or
injuries related to the head rest issue.</p>
            <p>The carmaker said that the active head restraints are designed
to mitigate neck injuries by automatically moving forward during
certain rear-impact collisions.</p>
            <p>It said that faulty microcontrollers in some vehicles "may
prevent the systems from functioning properly".</p>
            <p>Other recalls include 69,000 trucks to update their electronic
stability control software, and 1,060 commercial trucks - half of
which are with the dealers - to inspect and if necessary replace a
track-bar fastener.</p>
            <p>It is also recalling 226 of minivans made in 2013 - most of
which it said are in dealer hands - to replace their airbag-control
modules.</p>
            <p>Chrysler said "the modules were inadvertently programmed with
software that may compromise airbag deployment" but added that it
was not aware of any injuries or incident due to the issue.</p>
            <p>Eric Mayne, a spokesman for Chrysler said that the recalls were
"an indication of our aggressive quality control protocol".</p>
            <p>The majority of the vehicles impacted by the recall are in North
America.</p>
            <p>Last month, Chrysler agreed to recall 2.7 million Jeeps that
could be at risk of fuel tank fires, after initially refusing a
government request to do so.</p>
