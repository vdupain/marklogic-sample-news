               <span style="width:624px;">Living dangerously: The San Andreas fault runs down
the west coast of the US, meaning it is prone to earthquakes. In
1989, the strongest quake since 1906 San Francisco, killing 63,
injuring over 3,500</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Living in an earthquake zone adds a certain
spice to life.</p>
            <p>To the normal catastrophes of day to day
existence, you can add the possibility that the earth will open up
underneath you and swallow you whole.</p>
            <p>The first earthquake is scary - but unless a massive shaker
comes along you quickly become accustomed, even complacent.</p>
            <p>This is when being prepared becomes even more important - your
<a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-me-disaster17sep17-side,0,5062287.htmlstory">
survival kit</a> with plenty of bottled water, knowing where - and
where not - to shelter.</p>
            <p>And actually scrambling into these areas at 5am when a quake
hits, instead of rolling over, going back to sleep and assuming
it's not the 'big one' because you had a late night and don't want
to crawl out of bed.</p>
            <p>This is where being alerted to the fact this this isn't just a
tummy trembler, it's actually a potentially devastating 7.5 on the
Richter scale would be useful - because it could save your
life.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, early warning systems are hugely expensive pieces
of infrastructure to build from scratch.</p>
            <p>So a team from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech)
have created an app that uses the accelerometer in your smartphone,
and turns it into a simple seismometer (device that detects the
vibrations from earthquakes).</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Richard Guy has managed the Community Seismic
Network for the last two and a half years</span>
            </div>
            <p>Richard Guy is part of the team that put together CrowdShake,
with graduate computer science student Matt Faulkner.</p>
            <p>He manages Caltech's <a href="http://csn.caltech.edu/">Community
Seismic Network</a>, which has been running an earthquake
monitoring project for the past three and a half years, to
complement the more formal seismic monitoring services.</p>
            <p>"In the Pasadena area, which is a relatively small community -
it's hardly 10 kilometres across - we have hundreds and hundreds of
volunteers that we give a very small low-cost accelerometer to,
it's actually a seismometer," he says.</p>
            <p>The devices either plug into a PC or router, and pick up the
vibrations caused by tremors.</p>
            <p>Earthquake early warning systems rely on lots of sensors spread
over a region. So when an earthquake begins the closest stations
pick up the tremors.</p>
            <div class="caption full-width">

                 height="351"
                 alt="Tsunami sign"/>
               <span style="width:624px;">Be prepared: As a coastal state, tsunamis are also a
danger after quakes, as this sign on Venice Beach points
out</span>
            </div>
            <p>The data they gather is then sent to processing centres, where
the intensity is calculated, and the time it will take for the
quake to reach other areas. Then alerts are sent out. This system,
although more basic, works on the same principles.</p>
            <p>The project has hit a few bumps in the road - there's the cost
of the the devices, and the fact that some are simply never
installed.</p>
            <p>So the next logical step was a smartphone app called CrowdShake
- meaning no hardware to buy or maintain.</p>
            <p>"The attractiveness of smart phones is that they have many
things already built-in," says Mr Guy.</p>
            <p>"The accelerometer is already in the phone, the location is
something the phone knows, it's not something that a person has to
tell it.'</p>
            <p>"And of course your smartphone knows exactly what time it
is."</p>
            <div class="caption body-narrow-width">

                 alt="Community Seismic Network seismometer"/>
               <span style="width:304px;">This seismometer plugs into your home router. The
lid is removed to reveal the hardware</span>
            </div>
            <p>They are also easy to use, says Mr Guy.</p>
            <p>"From that point of view smartphones are an extraordinarily
attractive device for monitoring earthquakes."</p>
            <p>"Now on the other hand, they come with very interesting
challenges - the sensor, the accelerometer in a smartphone is
certainly not of the quality of any sort of a device you would add
to your PC or some other setting. So that's a basic challenge."</p>
            <p>Distinguishing normal movement from the vibrations from an
earthquake is also tricky.</p>
            <p>"If there are just enough [phones] that are stationary, which
could be a very small percentage, from that we can determine 'OK,
an earthquake is underway and this is how intense it was at a
certain point'," he says.</p>
            <p>The data is analysed and then pushed back to the community of
users.</p>
            <p>"Then the receiving phone says, 'Well, I know where I am, I know
where it started, I know the time difference between when the event
began, I know what time it is now, my little phone app can
calculate very, very simply in just a few milliseconds, this is how
bad I think it's going to be where I am right now.'</p>
            <p>"It can then provide ... an alert to this user saying: 'You have
so many seconds before a damaging wave will arrive'."</p>
            <p>At the moment the app is still a prototype. Implementation
across California is unlikely unless it is done by government
agencies, as the risk of litigation is so high - for example,
should someone be injured during a false alarm, says Mr Guy.</p>
            <p>So the target is the developing world - countries with a high
risk of earthquake, but don't have an early warning infrastructure
in place - but where mobile ownership is common.</p>

               <span style="width:624px;">Bhuj, in western India, suffered a
devastating earthquake in 2001. The region is being considered as a
testbed for CrowdShake</span>
            </div>
            <p>The big brother to the Community Seismic Network project is the
California Integrated Seismic Network's Earthquake Early Warning
System.</p>
            <p>"The network of seismometers is really a computer network," says
the director of Caltech's Earthquake Engineering Research
Laboratory, Tom Heaton.</p>
            <p>"We basically monitor all of the shaking that happens at roughly
about 400 stations in the western United States, and we have access
to that information within about a second of when the shaking
occurs at the station."</p>
            <p>When a quake is detected members of the network are alerted.</p>
            <p>"We've been writing software that does the kind of analysis a
human being would do if they had time to do it," he says.</p>
            <p>"The one that I work on is called the virtual seismologist,
we're trying to teach a computer to be like a seismologist, but
unlike a seismologist, computers can stay awake all the time and
they don't get bored."</p>
            <p>The early warning system <a href="http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2013/03/14/30891/caltech-earthquake-early-warning-system-predicts/">
has already been proven to work</a>. At Caltech they're working on
ways to send alerts to smart devices, which inevitably includes a
smartphone app.</p>

used during an earthquake drill held in Los Angeles in
March</span>
            </div>
            <p>"The app gets notification that an earthquake has occurred ....
it can project when the shaking will get to the phone and how big
it will be. And then the phone can start to countdown and say,
shaking in 10, 9, 8,Ã¢Â€Â¦ and even
give some idea - strong shaking or weak shaking depending on what
we anticipate."</p>
            <p>One of the big hold-ups is financing. The project has received
funding from the <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/">US Geological
Survey (USGS)</a> and more recently the <a href="http://www.moore.org/">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</a>,
while waiting to find whether a bill currently in front of the
state legislature will implement the system.</p>
            <p>Proof that this type of technology works can be found in
Japan.</p>
            <p>The country has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_Early_Warning_(Japan)">an
effective early warning system</a> administered by the <a href="http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/indexe.html">Japan Meteorological
Agency</a>. Thanks to apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yurekuru-call/id398954883?mt=8">Yurekuru
Call</a>, earthquake alerts can be pushed to smartphones, while the
iPhone 5 can do it automatically.</p>
            <p>No matter how sophisticated these systems are, there's only so
much a warning can do.</p>
            <p>In March 2011 the north-east of Japan <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12711226">experienced
the most powerful earthquake to have ever hit the country</a>,
measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale. This was followed by a tsunami
that inundated the Pacific coast.</p>
            <p>In Japan it is called the Great East Japan Earthquake. It is
thought that close to 20,000 people were killed.</p>

               <span style="width:624px;">Carp streamers - or koinoburi - are hung

            <p>The early warning system <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/423274/80-seconds-of-warning-for-tokyo/?p1=A3">
certainly saved lives</a>. But the scale of the disaster was just
too big. And the tsunami alert, which takes longer to compute and
generate, gave some only 15 minutes to get to higher ground.</p>
            <p>The American Red Cross has launched a suite of apps created by
UK-based developers <a href="http://www.3sidedcube.com/#work">3
Sided Cube</a> for use in natural disasters, one of which is for
earthquakes.</p>
            <p>It uses the USGS feed giving information on quakes as they
happen, and sends alerts to people who have set the app to watch
certain areas. It then sends them to a page with more
information.</p>

on what to do before, during and after earthquakes with
preparedness information developed by trusted Red Cross experts,"
says the American Red Cross's Matt Goldfeder.</p>
            <p>"The app also includes preparedness information for events that
may happen after earthquakes, such as fires and tsunamis."</p>
            <p>An 'I'm safe' button lets you send an alert to family, friends
and social networks, where you can also share information. It
includes a toolkit that has a torch setting, strobe light and an
alarm.</p>
            <p>"A recent Red Cross survey shows that nearly one-fifth of
Americans say they've received some kind of emergency information
from an app they've downloaded .... it's important that people can
access this information right on their mobile device," says Mr
Goldfeder.</p>
            <p>Other apps that claim to help in the aftermath include <a href="http://www.earthquakebuddy.com/">Earthquake Buddy</a>, which will
send an alert to four contacts if phone detects an earthquake, with
your GPS coordinates attached. For Californians <a href="http://myfaultapp.com/">MyFault</a> shows areas likely to be
subject to landslide or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_liquefaction">liquifaction</a>.</p>
            <p>And apps like <a href="http://quakefeed.net/">QuakeFeed</a> and
<a href="http://quakewatch.latenightprojects.com/">QuakeWatch</a>
let you track earthquakes around the world as they happen.</p>
            <p>Technology might not be able to save the world. But it might be
able give you and your loved ones the edge when it comes to
surviving the worst of natural disasters.</p>
