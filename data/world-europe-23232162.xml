the oil-for-food programme</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A French court has
cleared oil company Total, its chief executive and over a dozen
other defendants of corruption charges related to the UN's
oil-for-food programme in Iraq.</p>
            <p>The company had been accused of bribing Iraqi officials to
secure oil supplies while Saddam Hussein was in power.</p>
            <p>The UN programme permitted Iraq to sell limited quantities of
oil in return for humanitarian supplies.</p>
            <p>It was set up to ease international sanctions during the 1990s
and 2000s.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors had accused Total of circumventing a UN embargo
against Iraq by using intermediaries between 2000 and 2002 to pay
surcharges for oil, helping Saddam Hussein's government to raise
money illicitly.</p>
            <p>But the court in Paris ruled on Monday that there had been no
corruption, influence-peddling or misuse of assets by the company
during the programme, which ran from 1996 to 2003.</p>
            <p>Total Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie, French former
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua and a dozen more defendants had
denied participating in an illegal system that violated UN
regulations.</p>
            <p>During the trial, they said they had acted in strict accordance
with the rules of the UN programme, which was suspended after the
US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors now have 10 days to appeal the verdict.</p>
            <p>Corruption in the programme came to light in 2005 after <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/27_10_05_summary.pdf">a
UN enquiry led by US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker</a>
revealed that over 2,000 companies had paid a total of $1.8bn in
kickbacks for access to Iraqi oil.</p>
            <p>Iraqi officials selected preferred foreign partners, who then
used a variety of dodges to channel money to their own accounts or
back to Iraq.</p>
            <p>In a statement, Mr Pasqua, 86, said his only regret was that it
took eight years to establish "the inanity of the defamatory
accusations against me".</p>
