Moscow airport</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The father of leaker
Edward Snowden has said he believes his son would return to the US
on certain conditions.</p>
            <p>Lon Snowden asked for "ironclad assurances" his son's rights
would be protected in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder,
seen by the BBC.</p>
            <p>He asked his son not be held before trial nor subjected to a gag
order, and be able to choose where he was tried.</p>
            <p>Edward Snowden, who faces spy charges in the US, flew to Moscow
last weekend and has requested asylum in Ecuador.</p>
            <p>"Mr Snowden is reasonably confident that his son would
voluntarily return to the United States if there were ironclad
assurances that his constitutional rights would be honored," said
the letter by Lon Snowden's lawyer, Bruce Fein.</p>
            <p>The correspondence also requested for the case against the
former intelligence contractor to be dismissed in the event that
any of the three conditions were not met.</p>

            <p>Earlier on Friday, Lon Snowden told NBC News he had not spoken
to his son since April, a month before he fled to Hong Kong after
leaking to media details of a huge US snooping programme.</p>
            <p>Mr Snowden said his son had broken the law, but denied he was a
traitor.</p>
            <p>"At this point I don't feel that he's committed treason," he
said. "He has in fact broken US law, in a sense that he has
released classified information."</p>
            <p>He also voiced concern his son was being exploited by Wikileaks,
which has offered legal assistance to the 30-year-old.</p>
            <p>"I don't want to put him in peril, but I am concerned about
those who surround him," he said.</p>
            <p>"I think Wikileaks, if you've looked at past history, you know,
their focus isn't necessarily the constitution of the United
States. It's simply to release as much information as
possible."</p>
            <p>Mr Snowden flew last Sunday from Hong Kong to Moscow's
Sheremetyevo Airport, where Russian authorities say he remains in a
transit zone.</p>
            <p>On Friday, the diplomatic fallout from the affair continued as a
US envoy accused China of "misbehaviour" for allowing Mr Snowden to
leave.</p>
            <p>"I don't think we had a good-faith
partner throughout that process," said Stephen Young, the US consul
general in Hong Kong, warning of repercussions.</p>
            <p>The city's government has said the US arrest paperwork had
clerical errors, and that it had no legal basis to stop Mr Snowden
travelling to Russia.</p>
            <p>Beijing has accused the US of "double standards" on
cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>Ecuador says it has not yet processed the former US National
Security Agency contractor's request for asylum.</p>
            <p>Russian authorities complained on Friday the US had not informed
them in time that Mr Snowden's passport had been revoked, placing
Moscow in a "tough spot".</p>
            <p>"If this fact had been known in advance, then possibly Mr
Snowden might not have flown to Moscow and this entire story might
never have happened," an unnamed Russian official told Interfax
news agency.</p>
            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin this week refused to hand over
Mr Snowden to Washington, saying he was a "free man".</p>
            <p>Late on Thursday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro repeated
his offer of sanctuary to the US fugitive.</p>
