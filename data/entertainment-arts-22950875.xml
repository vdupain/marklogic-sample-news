runner-up The Uncertain Time by John Devane</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The winner and
runner-up of this year's BP Portrait Award are both artists who
have painted portraits of their children.</p>
            <p>South-African born artist Susanne du Toit won the
Ã‚Â£30,000 top prize for a portrait in oils of
her 35-year-old son Pieter.</p>
            <p>Coventry-based artist and teacher John Devane took the
Ã‚Â£10,000 second prize for a portrait of his
three children.</p>
            <p>The paintings will go on show at the National Portrait Gallery
in London.</p>
            <p>Gallery director Sandy Nairne called du Toit's painting "simple
but outstanding".</p>
            <p>Du Toit, who is now based in Crowthorne, Berkshire, also wins a
commission from the gallery's trustees worth
Ã‚Â£5,000.</p>
            <p>She painted her son as part of a series of portraits of her
family.</p>
            <p>She allowed Pieter to find his own pose, with the condition that
his hands would appear prominently as she finds them essential to
convey personality.</p>
            <p>"Having said that, the averted gaze of
this portrait, which was his choice, struck me as characteristic of
his reflective character, and became intensely engaging", she
said.</p>
            <p>This will be the second time Devane's work has been exhibited at
the BP Portrait Award - his picture In the House of The Cellist was
seen in the 1995 exhibition.</p>
            <p>He painted his children Lucy, 25, Laura, 20, and Louis, 15, over
a period of three years.</p>
            <p>The painting sets out to show how children emerge from childhood
and reveal something of their adult selves.</p>
            <p>Almost 2,000 artists from 77 different countries entered
portraits in the competition.</p>
            <p>55 portraits have been selected for the exhibition which opens
to the public at the gallery on Thursday (20 June) before
travelling to Aberdeen in November and Wolverhampton next year.</p>
            <p>Scottish painter Owen Normand, who studied at Edinburgh College
of Art but is now based in Berlin, won the
Ã‚Â£7,000 Young Artist Award.</p>
