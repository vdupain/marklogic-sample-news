            </div>
            <p class="introduction">International
lenders have paved the way for Greece to gain the latest payment of
bailout money.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-668_en.htm?locale=en">
The European Commission, European Central Bank and the
International Monetary Fund</a> said they had completed their fact
checking mission.</p>
            <p>They said the economic outlook was in line with their
projections but that it remained uncertain.</p>
            <p>Eurozone finance ministers will now decide whether to release
new funds worth 6.3bn euros ($8.1bn;
Ã‚Â£5.4bn).</p>
            <p>Talks have centred around 4,000 civil service jobs that are due
to be cut.</p>
            <p>The country has an unemployment rate of 27% and public unrest
has lead to political instability, and four different Greek
governments in as many years.</p>
            <p>On Sunday, public anger lead to the Mayor of Athens being
attacked after a meeting to discuss the job cuts.</p>
            <p>Giorgos Kaminis was briefly admitted to
hospital but was not seriously injured.</p>
            <p>His office said he was "shocked but not badly hurt".</p>
            <p>Meanwhile on Monday thousands of civil servants in Athens were
due to strike in protest at the next round of cuts.</p>
            <p>The union that represents the workers, the ADEDY, has called a
four-hour strike from noon.</p>
            <p>Greece has been dependent on loans from the European Union, the
International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, since
May 2010 and must pay off 6.6bn euros of debt by mid-August.</p>
            <p>One area of reform that has not been agreed upon by the bailout
bodies is the Greek government's plan to cut VAT for restaurants
and bars from 23% to 13%, which it hopes will boost income from
tourists - a major source of income for the country.</p>
            <p>The IMF, EU and ECB are not convinced this is a good plan.</p>
            <p>To win the bailout - the country's second - Greece pledged to
eliminate the 4,000 state jobs by the end of the year.</p>
            <p>It must also redeploy 25,000 civil servants, including some
2,000 teachers, and 3,500 local police are to be incorporated in
the national forces. All these measures have been met with fierce
opposition in Greece.</p>
            <p>The Greek coalition government came close to collapsing recently
following the shutdown of state broadcaster ERT.</p>

            </div>
            <p>TV Footage shows a small group chasing Giorgos Kaminis as he
rushes to safety. It is a sign of the anger felt here as 25,000
civil servants will be placed on reduced salaries and then either
dismissed or redeployed if posts are available. The Greek
government hopes a payout today will be a sign that it is back on
track after narrowly avoiding collapse last month in a political
crisis. But with rising unemployment and simmering anger over job
cuts, there is little sign yet of the glimmer of hope people here
crave.</p>
