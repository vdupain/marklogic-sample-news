               <span style="width:304px;">Troubled times in Greece</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Greece has passed
another hurdle in its bailout programme, by securing the next
instalments of funds that are keeping the country afloat.</p>
            <p>The money, totalling 6.8bn euros ($8.7bn), will come from the
troika of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
            <p>But they said that Greece's reform programme is moving too
slowly.</p>
            <p>The troika added that the country's economic outlook remains
uncertain.</p>
            <p>Eurozone finance ministers meeting in Brussels said 2.5bn euros
($3.2bn) would come from the eurozone rescue fund and 1.5bn euros
($1.9bn) from European Central Bank.</p>
            <p>While the payments are likely to be made this month, another
500m euros ($643m) from the rescue fund, plus 500m euros from the
European Central Bank will follow in October.</p>
            <p>Then the IMF will loan 1.8bn euros ($2.3bn), bringing the
overall total to 6.8bn euros.</p>
            <p>The loans are conditional on Greece
making progress with its reform programme.</p>
            <p>Greece's creditors have warned that reforms are behind schedule,
especially the privatisation of state assets. Last month, the
sell-off of the public gas company collapsed.</p>
            <p>But the reforms have caused much anger in Greece.</p>
            <p>Around 25,000 civil servants will be put on reduced salaries,
before either being dismissed or redeployed.</p>
            <p>That will add to the nation's unemployment rate which already
stands at 27%.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, thousands of Greek municipal workers and school
teachers took to the streets of Athens on Monday in a noisy protest
against public sector layoffs.</p>
            <p>Public unrest has lead to political instability, and four
different Greek governments in as many years.</p>

            <p>Eurozone Finance Ministers sounded a cautiously optimistic note
about the path ahead, predicting modest growth for the country next
year and no financing gap.</p>
            <p>It's been a shaky few weeks here, after the government almost
fell over a political crisis.</p>
            <p>The Prime Minister will hope this payout steadies the ship. But
the bailout money will run out in the next few months and debt
remains sky-high.</p>
            <p>The eurozone is taking the Greece problem on a month-by-month
basis. And nobody yet has answers for the long-term.</p>
