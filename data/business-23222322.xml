more than 1,100</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A group of 70
retailers have agreed a plan to conduct inspections of garment
factories in Bangladesh in an attempt to improve safety
standards.</p>
            <p>They will provide details of factories they source goods from,
which will be inspected within the next nine months.</p>
            <p>Funds will be made available for any safety upgrades needed at
the units.</p>
            <p>The legally-binding code was announced earlier this year after
the collapse of a garment factory in Bangladesh in April killed
more than 1,100 people.</p>
            <p>The eight-storey Rana Plaza building came crashing down on 24
April, a day after cracks had been spotted in the building.</p>
            <p>It was the deadliest in a series of accidents that have resulted
in global attention being focussed on safety standards in
Bangladesh's garments export industry, the second biggest in the
world after China's.</p>
            <p>Several big names, including Sweden's H&amp;M, the biggest buyer
of Bangladeshi-made clothes, signed up to the code after the
incident.</p>
            <p>It requires them not just to meet minimum fire and building
safety standards, but also to pay for them.</p>
            <p>Other signatories include Inditex, which owns Zara, Benetton,
Metro, Carrefour, Marks and Spencer, Tesco, Esprit and Abercrombie
&amp; Fitch.</p>
            <p>"This historic, legally binding accord will effect tangible
change on the ground and help make the Bangladeshi garment industry
safe and sustainable," said Jyrki Raina, general secretary of
IndustriALL, a labour group which played a key role in creating the
pact.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://www.industriall-union.org/bangladesh-safety-accord-implementation-moving-forward">
Mr Raina added</a> that the factory fires and collapses in
Bangladesh over the past few years indicated that efforts by
individual retailers had "proved insufficient" in addressing the
issue.</p>
            <p>"A profound change is possible only with a strong coalition
between trade unions, international brands and retailers,
Bangladeshi authorities and employers, and with worker involvement
in the workplace with guaranteed freedom of association."</p>
            <p>The International Development Secretary, Justine Greening, said
UK companies needed to play their part in helping raise standards:
"British business must be a force for good in the developing world
too, so that together we can help end aid dependency through
jobs."</p>
            <p>She said she had been talking to business leaders from the
retail industry to decide how they could work with the government
to improve supply chains, in order to ensure clothes were produced
responsibly and conditions were improved.</p>
            <p>Last month, US suspended trade privileges extended to Bangladesh
over concerns about dangerous working conditions and labour
rights.</p>
            <p>This decision was taken after a year-long review of labour
practices and workplace safety in Bangladesh.</p>
