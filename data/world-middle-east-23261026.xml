               <span style="width:304px;">Aleppo residents face food shortages and
price rises</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Dozens of Syrians in
Aleppo have staged protests against a rebel siege of
government-held areas in the city, residents have said.</p>
            <p>Rebels stopped supplies from entering western parts of the city
in a bid to weaken the supply routes for President Bashar
al-Assad's forces, they add.</p>
            <p>They say the blockade has led to severe food and medicine
shortages.</p>
            <p>The World Health Organization has urged Syrians to protect a
convoy carrying medical supplies to the city.</p>
            <p>One protester was reportedly shot dead at a demonstration on
Tuesday, according to the UK-based activist group the Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights.</p>
            <p>The group says it was not clear whether the man was shot by
rebels trying to disperse the protest or killed by army sniper
fire, as some civilians claimed.</p>
            <p>Amateur footage uploaded onto YouTube shows dozens of men in
civilian dress purportedly protesting at a checkpoint in the
rebel-held district of Bustan al-Qasr, chanting: "The people want
an end to the blockade."</p>
            <p>The protest is disrupted by several men in black, one carrying a
gun, followed by the sound of gunfire.</p>
            <p>Many Aleppo residents are angered by the rebel blockade, which
has created shortages of basics such as bread and flour, and hiked
up food prices in several neighbourhoods at the start of the
fasting month of Ramadan.</p>
            <p>Aid agencies have voiced concern over the growing humanitarian
crisis in the city after months of fierce fighting, with the World
Health Organization calling on both sides of the conflict to
guarantee the safety of a convoy carrying medical supplies to
Aleppo.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Government forces continue their
offensive on rebel-held areas of Homs</span>
            </div>
            <p>The UN's World Food Programme said it delivered food rations to
more than 250,000 people ahead of the start of fasting. However, it
also said that their aid shipments had been blocked by both sides
across the country in recent months.</p>
            <p>In Damascus, Syrian foreign ministry officials promised to
increase efforts "to send urgent humanitarian aid to Aleppo
province" after meeting UN representatives to discuss the
crisis.</p>
            <p>Residents in Homs are living under similar conditions, as
government forces close in on some of the last remaining rebel
positions there.</p>
            <p>The government says it is focusing its campaign on the northern
district of Khalidiya to root out "foreign subversion and domestic
terrorism".</p>
            <p>One activist told the BBC that hundreds of families were living
in "medieval conditions", with no electricity or running water.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, rebel fighters in Khalidiya are becoming increasingly
desperate, says the BBC's Paul Wood.</p>
            <p>They have uploaded amateur videos of themselves wearing suicide
belts, saying these are their only weapons now.</p>
            <p>Most of Homs has been recaptured by government troops backed by
Lebanon's Hezbollah.</p>
            <p>The UN says more than 90,000 people have been killed in Syria -
with a further 1.7 million forced to seek shelter in neighbouring
countries.</p>
