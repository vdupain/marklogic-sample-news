            </div>
            <p class="introduction">A US jury has said
Hyundai Motor must pay $14m (Ã‚Â£9m) in
damages to the family of a man who suffered traumatic brain injury
after side airbags in a Hyundai car he was driving failed to
deploy.</p>
            <p>Zachary Duncan's attorneys said the airbags did not deploy
because Hyundai put the sensors in the wrong location.</p>
            <p>The crash happened in 2010 and Mr Duncan was driving a Hyundai
Tiburon.</p>
            <p>South Korea's Hyundai has said that it disagrees with the
verdict and it plans to appeal against the decision.</p>
            <p>"This is an important victory for our client and for public
safety," Mr Duncan's lawyer, Ari Casper, was quoted as saying by
the Reuters news agency.</p>
            <p>"Hopefully, this will cause automobile manufacturers to really
make sure they're putting safe vehicles on the road."</p>
            <p>However, Hyundai said that the airbag system met federal safety
standards, and that it had been thoroughly tested and found to be
safe.</p>
            <p>Industry watchers said the incident appeared to be isolated and
therefore was not likely to damage Hyundai's reputation.</p>
            <p>"America is famously litigious," noted Derryn Wong,
editor-in-chief at Top Gear magazine in Singapore. "(Hyundai)
really do make rather safe cars."</p>
            <p>However, Mr Wong said there was a possibility the company would
issue a recall. "They might take steps to assuage the public," he
said.</p>
            <p>The US is the second largest market globally for Hyundai after
China.</p>
