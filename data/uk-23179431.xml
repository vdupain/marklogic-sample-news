request the collaboration of the British government in

            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Ecuador has asked
the UK to help an investigation over alleged spying at its embassy
in London where Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is living.</p>
            <p>Ecuador named a British company it claimed planted a listening
device in their ambassador's office but this was denied.</p>
            <p>Mr Assange has been staying at the embassy to avoid extradition
to Sweden.</p>
            <p>He is wanted there for questioning over allegations by two women
of sexual offences - which he denies.</p>
            <p>Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino told a news conference in Quito
the bug was found last month when Ecuadorean technicians reviewed
the embassy's wiring.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the bug, which was hidden inside an electrical
socket, was to listen to the conversations of Ambassador Ana Alban
in her office, Mr Patino said.</p>
            <p>Mr Assange lives and works in a different room in the
embassy.</p>
            <p>Mr Patino said: "We have reason to believe that the bugging was
carried out by The Surveillance Group Limited, one of the largest
private investigation and covert surveillance companies in the
United Kingdom."</p>
            <p>The system worked with a Sim card and could be activated by a
call from any mobile or fixed-line phone, he added.</p>
            <p>The Surveillance Group, which is based in
Worcester said Mr Patino's allegation was "wholly untrue".</p>
            <p>Chief executive Timothy Young said: "We have this morning heard
an accusation the source of which is apparently Ricardo Patino, the
Ecuadorean foreign minister suggesting that we have bugged the
Ecuadorean embassy.</p>
            <p>"This is completely untrue. The Surveillance Group do not and
have never been engaged in any activities of this nature.</p>
            <p>"We have not been contacted by any member of the Ecuadorean
government and our first notification about this incident was via
the press this morning."</p>
            <p>The UK and Ecuador have failed to reach agreement on how to deal
with Julian Assange, who faces arrest if he leaves the Ecuadorean
embassy.</p>
            <p>Mr Patino wants the UK to guarantee Mr Assange safe passage to
Ecuador, but the UK maintains it has a legal obligation to
extradite him to Sweden.</p>
            <p>Mr Assange's organisation Wikileaks says it is advising US
intelligence leaker Edward Snowden, who is reportedly seeking
asylum in more than 20 countries to avoid extradition to the
US.</p>
            <p>Mr Snowden, who is currently thought to be in Moscow airport, is
wanted on charges of leaking secrets he gathered while working as a
contractor for the National Security Agency - America's electronic
spying agency.</p>
