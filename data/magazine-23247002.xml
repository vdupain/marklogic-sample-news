            <p class="introduction">Edward Snowden is getting advice and
support from an eclectic bunch, ranging from a constitutional
lawyer to a former Russian spy.</p>
            <p>After leaking information about surveillance operations, Snowden
has been on the lam. And since arriving in Moscow on 23 June, he
has been in legal limbo.</p>
            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said he would grant Snowden
asylum in Russia - so long as he agreed to stop leaking US secrets.
Snowden has meanwhile requested asylum in at least 19
countries.</p>
            <p>Snowden is now considering his options, with Venezuela as a
possibility. Here are the legal experts and activists who are
helping him make a decision about his next move.</p>
