            <p class="introduction">French MPs have
approved a bill forcing restaurants to label as "home-made" dishes
which were prepared from raw ingredients in their kitchen.</p>
            <p>The "fait maison" label on menus is aimed at curbing the
practice of buying in pre-cooked meals from outside, microwaving
them and passing them off as freshly made.</p>
            <p>Restaurants marking dishes as "fait maison" fraudulently will be
fined.</p>
            <p>The Senate (upper house) still has to back the bill for it to
become law.</p>
            <p>MPs from both the ruling Socialist Party and opposition
centre-right UMP called for the measure to be obligatory,
overruling Business and Tourism Minister Sylvia Pinel, who did not
want it to go that far.</p>
            <p>"We're making things more transparent and restoring our trade's
respectability," said Didier Chenet, head of restaurant federation
Synhorcat.</p>
            <p>"Clients will know what to expect. The problem right now is that
you push the door of a restaurant and you don't know if there's
actually a chef in the kitchen," he told Reuters news agency.</p>
