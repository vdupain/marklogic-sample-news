player Josenir dos Santos refused to leave the pitch</span>

            <p class="introduction">Football spectators
in northern Brazil decapitated a referee after he fatally stabbed a
player for refusing to leave the pitch, officials say.</p>
            <p>An angry mob stormed the field during the amateur game in the
state of Maranhao and stoned Otavio da Silva to death before
severing his head.</p>
            <p>Police said the murder was in retaliation for Mr Silva stabbing
player Josenir dos Santos.</p>
            <p>One man has been arrested over the killing and investigations
continue.</p>
            <p>The incident took place on 30 June in the remote town of Pio
XII, but news of the event has been slow to emerge.</p>
            <p>The state's Public Safety Department said it started when the
referee and Mr Santos got into fist fight after the player was sent
off but refused to leave the pitch.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Mr Silva then pulled out a knife and wounded Mr Santos, who died
on his way to the hospital.</p>
            <p>The player's friends and relatives rushed onto the field, stoned
the referee to death and dismembered his body, the department said
in a statement.</p>
            <p>So far police have arrested a 27-year-old man in connection with
the crime.</p>
            <p>"We will identify and hold accountable all those involved,"
police chief Valter Costa was quoted as saying by local media.</p>
            <p>"One crime will never justify another."</p>
