            <p class="introduction">Israel's President
Shimon Peres has begun celebrations for his upcoming 90th birthday
in the company of celebrities and world leaders.</p>
            <p>British former Prime Minister Tony Blair and US ex-President
Bill Clinton were among guests at Jerusalem's convention centre
late on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>Singer Barbra Streisand performed, with actors Robert De Niro
and Sharon Stone also in attendance.</p>
            <p>A series of events are planned ahead of Mr Peres's birthday in
August.</p>
            <p>Tuesday's gala marked the start of Israel's annual presidential
conference, an event that is funded by individuals and foundations
at a cost $3m (Ã‚Â£1.9m).</p>
            <p>Some 5,000 people are expected to take part in two days of
discussions on the theme of "Facing Tomorrow".</p>
            <p>The VIP guest list for the opening party showed the high
international esteem in which Mr Peres is held.</p>
            <p>Opening his speech, Mr Blair, now a special envoy to the Middle
East, said: "We in Britain have our Queen, you have your Shimon"
before going on to praise the president's leadership qualities.</p>
            <p>US President Barack Obama, who was in Northern Ireland for a G8
summit, sent a pre-recorded message expressing his birthday wishes
to Mr Peres "on behalf of the American people".</p>
            <p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also sent a tribute, as did
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.</p>
            <p>When President Peres took to the podium, he called for an end to
the conflict in the Middle East.</p>
            <p>"We want peace with our neighbours," he said. "The yesterday
between us and the Palestinians is full of sorrow."</p>
            <p>"I believe that the Israel of tomorrow and the Palestine of
tomorrow can give our children light and hope."</p>
            <p>The political career of Polish-born Mr Peres spans six decades.
He has served twice as prime minister of Israel.</p>
            <p>He is credited with starting the country's nuclear programme and
was closely involved with the early creation of Jewish settlements
in the occupied West Bank.</p>
            <p>He went on to promote peace between Israel and the
Palestinians.</p>
            <p>In 1994, a year after the signing of the Oslo Accords, he was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with Israel's then-Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and then-Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.</p>
            <p>Although he was not popular during much of his political career,
Israelis have built up a deep affection for him that has been
widely expressed during nearly six years as Israel's president.</p>
