            <p class="introduction">A German court has
rejected a journalist's request to see all German secret service
files on a top Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann.</p>
            <p>The foreign intelligence agency (BND) had given the Bild
newspaper journalist documents on Eichmann with some passages
blacked out.</p>
            <p>Eichmann organised deportations of Jews to Nazi death camps in
World War II.</p>
            <p>He fled to Argentina after the war, but was kidnapped by Israeli
agents and hanged after a trial in Israel in 1962.</p>
            <p>Germany's Federal Administrative Court ruled that the BND had
the right to keep parts of its Eichmann records secret.</p>
            <p>Bild has been trying to establish how much the BND may have
known about Eichmann's hiding place after the war.</p>
            <p>Agents from the Israeli spy agency Mossad tracked him down in
Buenos Aires in 1960.</p>
            <p>A senior SS officer, Eichmann had been in charge of managing the
logistics of the Holocaust.</p>
            <p>He personally directed the plunder, ghettoisation and
deportation of more than 437,000 Jews in Nazi-occupied Hungary in
1944.</p>
            <p>Most of those deported were murdered in the Auschwitz-Birkenau
death camp in southern Poland.</p>
