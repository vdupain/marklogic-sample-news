            </div>
            <p class="introduction">President Evo
Morales has threatened to close the US embassy in Bolivia after his
official plane was banned from European airspace.</p>
            <p>The warning came as four other South American leaders offered
him support at a special summit on Thursday.</p>
            <p>His plane was forced to land in Austria on Tuesday after France,
Portugal, Italy and Spain apparently barred it from flying through
their airspace.</p>
            <p>There were unfounded suspicions that US fugitive Edward Snowden
was on board.</p>
            <p>The Bolivian president blamed Washington for pressurising
European countries into refusing him passage.</p>
            <p>"My hand would not tremble to close the US embassy," Mr Morales
said.</p>
            <p>"We have dignity, sovereignty. Without America, we are better
off politically and democratically."</p>
            <p>His presidential jet was rerouted as he travelled from a meeting
in Russia where he had suggested he would be willing to consider an
asylum application from Mr Snowden.</p>

espionage charges</span>

            <p>The former CIA contractor is believed to be holed up at the
transit area of Moscow airport after leaking details of a vast US
surveillance programme.</p>
            <p>Mr Morales was joined by the presidents of Argentina, Uruguay,
Ecuador, Venezuela and Suriname at a meeting to discuss the plane
dispute in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba on Thursday.</p>
            <p>The leaders issued a statement after the meeting demanding an
explanation from France, Portugal, Italy and Spain over their
actions.</p>
            <p>The US was not mentioned in the statement, but several of the
leaders criticised the Americans in comments after the meeting.</p>
            <p>"If this had happened to the president of the United States, it
probably would have been grounds for war," said Ecuadorean
President Rafael Correa.</p>
            <p>"They think they can attack, crush, destroy international
law."</p>
            <p>Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said in a
TV interview on Friday that Madrid had "no reason to
apologise".</p>
            <p>He said airspace was never closed to Mr Morales' plane, but that
the delay in Austria meant the flight permit had expired and had to
be renewed.</p>
            <p>He also said in reference to Mr Snowden: "They told us he was
inside [the plane]."</p>
            <p>Mr Garcia-Margallo's comment is the first official recognition
by the European states that the incident with Mr Morales' plane was
connected with the Snowden affair.</p>
            <p>However, he did not say who had given the information to the
Spanish authorities.</p>
            <p>France earlier apologised for the plane incident, blaming it on
"conflicting information".</p>
            <p>The US state department has not commented directly on the latest
claims, saying only that Washington had "been in touch with a broad
range of countries" over the Snowden case.</p>
            <p>Demonstrators marched on the French embassy in La Paz on
Wednesday, burning the French flag and demanding the expulsion of
the ambassador to Bolivia.</p>
            <p>Mr Morales' plane took off from Vienna on Wednesday morning and
arrived back in La Paz on Wednesday night.</p>
