            <p class="introduction">The Chilean Supreme
Court has approved the extradition of a former Argentine judge
accused of human rights abuses during the 1976-1983 military
rule.</p>
            <p>Otilio Romano has been accused in Argentina of complicity in
forced disappearances, torture and illegal raids while serving as a
state prosecutor in the city of Mendoza.</p>
            <p>He fled to Chile when the allegations emerged two years ago.</p>
            <p>Mr Romano says he will appeal against his extradition.</p>
            <p>Human rights groups estimate that at least 30,000 people were
killed during the military government era in Argentina.</p>
            <p>The period became known as the "Dirty War".</p>
            <p>The military government said they needed to combat "left-wing
terrorism".</p>
            <p>Otilio Romano was suspended from the post of judge in August
2011.</p>
            <p>The day before the decision was announced he fled to Chile to
avoid trial and asked for political asylum there, the Buenos Aires
Herald reports.</p>
            <p>Chile rejected the request and placed him under house
arrest.</p>
            <p>In December 2011, he was expelled from the Council of
Magistrates, which considered him an accomplice of the military
government in human rights abuses.</p>
