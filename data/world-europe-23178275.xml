               <span style="width:304px;">Portugal's prime minister has faced a
wave of street protests over austerity</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Portugal's prime
minister has been meeting his former foreign minister, who resigned
this week, trying to persuade him to rescue their coalition.</p>
            <p>Talks have been called "constructive" - bringing calm to markets
that had feared a possible government collapse.</p>
            <p>PM Pedro Passos Coelho is keen to defuse the political crisis
and avoid the turmoil of an early election.</p>
            <p>President Anibal Cavaco Silva is due to begin talks with the
parties on Monday.</p>
            <p>The ruling coalition is under intense pressure to stick to the
tough austerity targets dictated by Portugal's bailout.</p>
            <p>Yields on 10-year Portuguese bonds fell to 7.26% early on
Thursday. A sharp spike - topping 8% on Wednesday - had revived
market jitters about instability in the eurozone.</p>
            <p>Portugal has doggedly stuck to its austerity programme, despite
its severe recession.</p>
            <p>That has angered trade unions and left-wing parties but brought
praise from Portugal's international partners.</p>
            <p>"I think Portugal has achieved very remarkable results -
certainly, it's been a painful route - and the results that have
been achieved have been quite significant, remarkable, if not
outstanding," European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said on
Thursday.</p>
            <p>Mr Cavaco Silva is known to be keen to avoid calling early
elections, the BBC's Alison Roberts reports from Lisbon.</p>
            <p>He is clearly putting pressure on the coalition to patch things
up, given the adverse reaction to the crisis in the markets, our
correspondent says.</p>
            <p>Left-wing opposition parties are demanding early elections, and
opinion polls suggest the ruling conservatives would do badly. The
Communist Party held a big anti-government rally in central Lisbon
on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>The crisis began on Monday with the resignation of Finance
Minister Vitor Gaspar, who for two years had overseen the unpopular
austerity policies.</p>
            <p>The prime minister's choice to replace him, the former Treasury
Secretary Maria Luis Albuquerque, is seen as just as wedded to
austerity, says our Lisbon correspondent.</p>
            <p>It was that fact that the foreign minister and junior coalition
leader, Paulo Portas, cited in tendering his resignation on
Tuesday.</p>
            <p>The European Commission President, Jose Manuel Barroso, said he
was following the situation "with concern".</p>
            <p>Portugal received a bailout worth more than 78bn euros ($102bn;
Ã‚Â£67bn) in May 2011, on the condition it
implemented austerity measures.</p>
            <p>Demonstrators have taken to the streets in recent days to
protest against planned austerity reforms.</p>
            <p>Portugal has been in recession for two years and the economy is
expected to contract by 2.3% this year.</p>
