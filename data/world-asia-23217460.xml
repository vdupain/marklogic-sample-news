               <span style="width:464px;">The huge Gunung Leuser national park
straddles the border of North Sumatra and Aceh
provinces</span>

            <p class="introduction">Several tigers have
trapped five Indonesian men up a tree in a national park on Sumatra
island, after mauling a sixth person to death, police say.</p>
            <p>The group was attacked on Thursday after they accidentally
killed a tiger cub. One man died while the others managed to flee
up some branches.</p>
            <p>The survivors alerted nearby villagers using mobile phones.</p>
            <p>It could take rescue crews up to three days before they find the
men in the Gunung Leuser jungle, officials said.</p>
            <p>The national park covers nearly 7,930 sq km (3,060 sq miles)
along the border of North Sumatra and Aceh provinces.</p>
            <p>A 30-member search team entered the jungle on Saturday, police
chief Dicky Sondani said.</p>
            <p>"It might need two or three days to walk on foot to the depths
of the jungle," he said</p>
            <p>Villagers had tried to rescue the men on Thursday but retreated
when they saw at least four large Sumatran tigers circling around
the base of the tree.</p>
            <p>"If the tigers remain under the tree, we may have to shoot or
sedate them to rescue the five people," Mr Sodani added.</p>
            <p>The six men, all from Simpang Kiri village in Aceh Tamiang
district, had ventured into the national park in search of rare
incense wood.</p>
            <p>"People keep entering the jungle to look for the wood because
it's very expensive," the police chief said.</p>
            <p>"But that's the risk: there are many tigers and elephants in
Gunung Leuser jungle."</p>
            <p>The group set up deer traps for food, but accidentally caught a
tiger cub.</p>
            <p>The injured animal drew nearby tigers who then pounced on the
men and killed a 28-year-old only identified as David.</p>
            <p>The smallest of all tigers, Sumatran tigers are a critically
endangered species only found on the Indonesian island.</p>
            <p>As few as 350 <a href="http://www.tigertrust.info/sumatran_tiger_tiger.asp"
               title="Tiger Trust">remain in the wild</a>, of which the largest
population lives in the Gunung Leuser national park.</p>
