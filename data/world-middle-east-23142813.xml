            <p class="introduction">A Palestinian
teenager has been killed during clashes with Israeli troops in the
West Bank.</p>
            <p>Moataz Sharawna, 19, died after being shot and, according to
Palestinians, subsequently hit by an army vehicle.</p>
            <p>It followed confrontations between stone-throwing youths and
soldiers in the village of Dura, south of the city of Hebron.</p>
            <p>The Israel military said it was investigating the circumstances
of Mr Sharawna's death.</p>
            <p>A military spokeswoman confirmed that a young Palestinian man
was shot.</p>
            <p>"Palestinians hurled stones at security forces, which responded
with crowd-control measures," the spokeswoman said.</p>
            <p>A Palestinian witness told the BBC that Mr Sharawna had been
throwing stones and then climbed on top of an Israeli army
jeep.</p>
            <p>He said that soldiers fired at him and he was then run over by
another army vehicle.</p>
            <p>Locals said that there was a large deployment of Israeli troops
in Dura after the incident and that several checkpoints were set
up.</p>
