            <p class="introduction">At least 22 people
have died in a suicide bomb attack targeting a Shia mosque in the
Iraqi town of Muqdadiyah on Monday evening, police say.</p>
            <p>The attack came on the same day the UN mission in Iraq released
figures indicating that over 2,500 Iraqis have died in violent
attacks since April.</p>
            <p>Muqdadiyah is located 80km (50 miles) north-east of the capital,
Baghdad.</p>
            <p>It is the latest in a series of deadly sectarian attacks to
strike Iraq's Diyala province.</p>
            <p>Iraq has been suffering its worst sectarian violence in several
years with May the bloodiest month since June 2008, according to
recent figures.</p>
            <p>However, the UN's latest casualties figures show a drop in the
number of fatalities from 1,045 in May to 761 in June.</p>
            <p>A suicide bomber set off his explosive belt at the funeral
ceremony of a police officer in Muqdadiyah late on Monday, police
say.</p>
            <p>The police officer was reportedly killed in a recent roadside
bomb attack.</p>
            <p>The explosion brought down the ceiling of the mosque, with
people still believed to be trapped beneath the rubble.</p>
            <p>A separate attack targeting a cafe in the
central city of Baquba reportedly killed at least eight people and
wounded 20 others on Monday.</p>
            <p>In June, 10 Iranian Shia pilgrims were killed after a suicide
bomber rammed a car packed with explosives into a bus in
Muqdadiyah.</p>
            <p>The recent surge in violence comes amid heightened tensions
between Iraq's Sunni and Shia communities, amid claims by the
Sunnis that they are being marginalised by Prime Minister Nouri
Maliki's Shia-led government.</p>
            <p>Violence erupted in April when Iraqi security forces stormed an
anti-government Sunni protest in the city of Hawija, killing and
wounding dozens of protesters.</p>
