            <p class="introduction">A former North
Vietnamese soldier has been reunited with his arm after more than
40 years.</p>
            <p>Nguyen Quang Hung fought during the Vietnam war and had his arm
amputated by US army doctor Sam Axelrad in 1966 after his arm
caught gangrene.</p>
            <p>Dr Axelrad kept the bones of the arm as a reminder of the good
deed he had performed by treating an enemy soldier.</p>
            <p>He began a quest to track down the owner of the arm in 2012,
meeting Mr Hung on Monday to return his bones.</p>
            <p>"I'm very happy to see him again and have that part of my body
back after nearly half a century," Mr Hung said.</p>
            <p>"My arm bone is evidence of my contribution to the war. I will
keep it in my house... in the glass display cabinet," he said,
adding that he hoped the arm would help him claim a veteran's
pension, as his army files had been lost.</p>
            <p>He also plans to be buried with his bones.</p>

arm in 1966</span>
            </div>
            <p>Dr Axelrad said he was "unbelievably happy" to be able to return
the arm.</p>
            <p>"When I amputated his arm [in 1966], our medics took the arm,
took the flesh off it, put it back together perfectly with wires,
and then they gave it to me," he said.</p>
            <p>"When I left the country six months later, I didn't want to
throw it away, I put it in my trunk and brought it home, and all
these years it has been in my house," he added.</p>
            <p>In 2011, he returned to Vietnam and tried to find the man whose
arm he had amputated - a move he later said would help provide
"closure".</p>
            <p>A local journalist wrote about his mission, and the news
eventually spread back to Mr Hung.</p>
            <p>When he heard he would get his arm back he said he "really could
not believe it".</p>
            <p>"I can't believe that an American doctor took my infected arm,
got rid of the flesh, dried it, took it home and kept it for more
than 40 years," he said.</p>
            <p>He added later that he considered himself "very lucky" compared
to many of his comrades who died in the war.</p>
            <p>The Vietnam war, which ended in 1975, killed an estimated 58,000
US soldiers and three million Vietnamese.</p>
