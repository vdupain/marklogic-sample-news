            <p class="introduction">Argentina has
scrapped a gold-mining deal with Canadian firm Osisko, after
protests by environmental campaigners.</p>
            <p>The authorities in north-western La Rioja province said they had
not managed to get the consent of the people for the project.</p>
            <p>Osisko suspended work in February because of the protests.</p>
            <p>The deal was first announced in 2011, but campaign groups
including Greenpeace backed local opposition to the project.</p>
            <p>The protesters said mining at the Famatina mountain would
require a million litres of water a day.</p>
            <p>They also expressed fears over the use of cyanide to extract
precious metals.</p>
            <p>La Rioja's regional governor, Luis Beder Herrera, said "constant
episodes of confrontation" had made it impossible to start the
project.</p>
            <p>He said the cancellation would have "serious social and economic
consequences".</p>
            <p>In an earlier statement, Osisko said it would prepare a
consultation programme about the project.</p>
            <p>The firm said it would not carry out any work in the area if
there was "no social licence for exploration and development".</p>
