            <p class="introduction">The inventor of the
computer mouse, Doug Engelbart, has died aged 88.</p>
            <p>Engelbart developed the tool in the 1960s as a wooden shell
covering two metal wheels, patenting it long before the mouse's
widespread use.</p>
            <p>He also worked on early incarnations of email, word processing
and video teleconferences at a California research institute.</p>
            <p>The state's Computer History Museum was notified of his death by
his daughter, Christina, in an email.</p>
            <p>Her father had been in poor health and died peacefully on
Tuesday night in his sleep, she said.</p>
            <p>Doug Engelbart was born on 30 January 1925 in Portland, Oregon,
to a radio repairman father and a housewife mother.</p>
            <p>He studied electrical engineering at Oregon State University and
served as a radar technician during World War II.</p>

               <p class="caption">Dr Engelbart's first ever mouse demo</p>
            </div>
            <p>He then worked at Nasa's predecessor, Naca, as an electrical
engineer, but soon left to pursue a doctorate at University of
California, Berkeley.</p>
            <p>His interest in how computers could be used to aid human
cognition eventually led him to Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
and then his own laboratory, the Augmentation Research Center.</p>
            <p>His laboratory helped develop ARPANet, the government research
network that led to the internet.</p>
            <p>Engelbart's ideas were way ahead of their time in an era when
computers took up entire rooms and data was fed into the hulking
machines on punch cards.</p>
            <p>At a now legendary presentation that became known as the "mother
of all demos" in San Francisco in 1968, he made the first public
demonstration of the mouse.</p>
            <p>At the same event, he held the first video teleconference and
explained his theory of text-based links, which would form the
architecture of the internet.</p>
            <p>He did not make much money from the mouse because its patent ran
out in 1987, before the device became widely used.</p>
            <p>SRI licensed the technology in 1983 for $40,000
(Ã‚Â£26,000) to Apple.</p>
            <p>At least one billion computer mice have been sold.</p>
            <p>Engelbart had considered other designs for his most famous
invention, including a device that could be fixed underneath a
table and operated by the knee.</p>

            </div>
            <p>He was said to have been driven by the belief that computers
could be used to augment human intellect.</p>
            <p>Engelbart was awarded the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT prize in 1997
and the National Medal of Technology for "creating the foundations
of personal computing" in 2000.</p>
            <p>Since 2005, he had been a fellow at the Computer History Museum
in Mountain View, California.</p>
            <p>He is survived by his second wife, Karen O'Leary Engelbart, and
four children.</p>
