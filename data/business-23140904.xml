owned about $11m of Bitcoins</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Tyler and Cameron
Winklevoss, famed for their legal dispute with Facebook's Mark
Zuckerberg, have unveiled plans to float a Bitcoin trust.</p>
            <p>The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust will initially sell $20m
(Ã‚Â£13m) worth of shares to investors,
according to a filing with the US regulators.</p>
            <p>The twins are among the key backers of Bitcoin, a virtual
currency traded independently of monetary authorities.</p>
            <p>Its value jumped earlier this year, but has been highly
volatile.</p>
            <p>In January its value surged from $15 for each Bitcoin, <a href="http://blockchain.info/charts/market-price">to a high of $260 on
10 April</a>, before crashing.</p>
            <p>Bitcoins are now trading at a price of about $90 each.</p>
            <p>Like other currencies, Bitcoins are used to buy goods and
services, with companies selling anything from software to online
dating accepting it as payment.</p>
            <p>The currency is created by the application of a mathematical
formula in a process known as "Bitcoin mining".</p>
            <p>A key feature of Bitcoins is that their supply can never exceed
a certain number - 21 million - which has led some to speculate
that their value may rise further.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579346/000119312513279830/d562329ds1.htm">
In their filing with the</a> US Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), the twins said that shares in the trust were "designed for
investors seeking a cost-effective and convenient means to gain
exposure to Bitcoins with minimal credit risk".</p>
            <p>The trust fund is to be listed on an as-yet-undetermined
exchange - such as Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
            <p>The value of the fund is expected to track closely the value of
the underlying Bitcoins in which it will be invested.</p>
            <p>But - unlike with Bitcoins - the intention is that investors
will be able to sell shares in the trust fund short, in effect
allowing them to speculate that the value of Bitcoins will
fall.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, the Winklevoss twins had told the New York
Times that they owned about $11m of the virtual coins - about 1% of
the global supply.</p>
            <p>They have set up Math-Based Asset Services LLC which will be the
sponsor of the trust.</p>
            <p>The SEC filing warned that as "the sponsor and its management
have no history of operating an investment vehicle like the Trust,
their experience may be inadequate or unsuitable to manage the
Trust".</p>
