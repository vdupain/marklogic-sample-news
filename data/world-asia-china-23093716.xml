            <p class="introduction">A Chinese official
at the centre of a sex tape extortion scandal that became an
internet sensation has been jailed for 13 years for accepting
bribes.</p>
            <p>Lei Zhengfu, formerly a senior official in China's Chongqing
district, was sacked from his post after a sex tape featuring him
was put online last year.</p>
            <p>He has also been fined 300,000 yuan ($48,000;
Ã‚Â£32,000).</p>
            <p>The investigation into his activities began after the release of
the sex video which captivated public opinion.</p>
            <p>Lei was also convicted of accepting bribes of around 3.16m
Chinese yuan ($510,000; Ã‚Â£330,000). His
lawyer says he may appeal, Chinese state media reported.</p>
            <p>A businessman who lured the official into the sexual encounter
in order to blackmail him has been sentenced to 10 years in
prison.</p>
            <p>At least 10 other officials have also been dismissed as a result
of the scandal.</p>
            <p>Millions of people in China saw video clips posted on the
internet of the portly, balding former Communist Party official
having sex with a woman hired by property developers.</p>
            <p>The 18-year-old woman involved had secretly recorded the video
as part of an elaborate blackmail plot.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Official corruption is becoming
increasingly frowned upon in China</span>
            </div>
            <p>The lurid details of the affair have thrown a light on the links
between sex, money and power in Chinese society, correspondents
say.</p>
            <p>Lei asked another property developer who had benefited from his
patronage to pay hush money of 3m yuan to the blackmailers. He
argued that the money was a loan, but prosecutors said the cash -
not fully repaid - amounted to a bribe.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors also said Lei took two other bribes in return for
favours granted through his government position.</p>
            <p>But it was the sex scandal and the scheme behind it that most
disgusted the Chinese public, shocked by what they saw as the moral
degradation of those in power.</p>
            <p>Correspondents say that while at least 20 other party stalwarts
have been caught up in the sex extortion scheme, Lei appears to
have been singled out. Some analysts suggest he was given harsher
treatment because of his notoriety among Chinese internet
users.</p>
            <p>The woman in the video with Lei was given a suspended two-year
sentence.</p>
            <p>The businessman, Xiao Ye, was found guilty of luring several
officials into so-called "honey traps".</p>
            <p>His idea was to use the videos to extort money or ensure
favourable contracts for property developments, reports say.</p>
            <p>The blackmail scheme was exposed by a blogger and investigative
journalist, Zhu Ruifeng.</p>
            <p>President Xi Jinping has made cracking down on corruption a key
priority since becoming China's leader. It is a problem the
Communist party has been unsuccessfully trying to stamp out for
decades.</p>
