               <span style="width:304px;">China is one of the biggest markets for
many global car makers, including Hyundai</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Shares of South
Korean car makers Hyundai and Kia have fallen by about 5% on fears
of a dip in sales in China.</p>
            <p>The concerns were triggered after China's state-owned Xinhua
news agency reported that eight Chinese cities were likely to
implement curbs on car sales.</p>
            <p>The move is being seen as an attempt by authorities to try to
control high pollution levels in China.</p>
            <p>China is the world's biggest car market and a key driver of
growth for firms such as Hyundai.</p>
            <p>"China accounts for about 20% of Hyundai Motor's total sales,
and such news dampens its China sales outlook," said Suh Sung-moon,
an analyst at Korea Investment &amp; Securities.</p>
            <p>According to the Xinhua report, the eight cities are Tianjin,
Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Shijiazhuang, Chongqing, Qingdao and
Wuhan.</p>
            <p>If implemented, the restrictions could see car sales dwindle by
about 400,000 units, it said.</p>
            <p>Pollution levels in China have risen over the past few years and
the country is now the world's biggest polluter.</p>
            <p>Poor air quality has become a key political and social issue in
China, and some of the biggest and most successful recent protests
in China have been triggered by environmental concerns.</p>
            <p>Anger over air pollution in Beijing, expressed mainly in online
forums, led the local government to change the way in which it
monitored pollution levels.</p>
            <p>China new leaders have said that improving the quality of life
for Chinese citizens is a key policy measure for them.</p>
            <p>Last month, the government ordered firms in heavy-polluting
industries to cut emissions by 30% by 2017.</p>
