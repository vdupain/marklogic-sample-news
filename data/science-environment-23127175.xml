            <p class="introduction">Germany's rapid
transition to renewable energy is said to be the country's biggest
and most expensive project since the fall of the Berlin wall - but
with rising costs for consumers and industry, will this great
energy experiment succeed?</p>
            <p>The powerful whiff of farmyard manure cannot dim the smiles on
people's faces in the German village of Juehnde.</p>
            <p>Located in the heart of the country, this rural community is
home to Germany's <a href="http://www.bioenergiedorf.de/con/cms/front_content.php?idcat=12&amp;changelang=6">
first energy co-operative</a> that started in 2005.</p>
            <p>The co-op generates electricity from solar panels and from a
biogas plant that mixes locally grown grain and locally sourced
farm waste.</p>
            <p>The residents are happy because they get
cheap power and heat and thanks to the <a href="http://energytransition.de/2012/10/renewable-energy-act-with-feed-in-tariffs/">
feed-in tariff laws</a> that allow them to sell the surplus energy
to the national grid, they bank a healthy annual return on their
investment to boot.</p>
            <p>"It makes money," says Eckhard Fangmeier with a quiet grin. He
has been with the co-op since the start.</p>
            <p>"We are a very small, rural place, with normal people.</p>
            <p>The success has been based on the feed-in tariff, without it we
couldn't live here in an economic way. It's a basic."</p>
            <p>Across Germany, co-operatives, farmers and homeowners are part
of the 1.3 million renewable energy producers who have taken
advantage of this generous tariff scheme. It pays a fixed price for
20 years. More importantly, it guarantees priority access to the
grid, ahead of the big utility companies.</p>
            <p>As a result, houses now sport shiny solar cells on their roofs
and wind turbines are spreading through the country like a giant
metallic army.</p>
            <p>Across Bavaria, it is said there are more photovoltaic panels
installed than in the entire United States.</p>
            <p>This being Germany, this remarkable
transformation has a name. It is called the <em>energiewende</em>,
or energy transformation. The rapid take up of renewables means
that in 2012, these green entrepreneurs <a href="http://bdew.de/internet.nsf/id/20130110-pi-mueller-2013-is-an-important-year-for-the-german-energy-policy-en?open&amp;ccm=900010020010">
provided 22% of Germany's electricity</a>.</p>
            <p>And it doesn't stop at electricity generation. The
<em>energiewende</em> is encouraging change throughout the
system.</p>
            <p>On the busy streets of Berlin, 26 year-old Arwen Colell wheels
her bike to choir practice. A political scientist, she leads a
<a href="http://www.buerger-energie-berlin.de/">community
co-operative</a> that wants to take control of the capital's
electricity grid with its 35,000km of underground cables.</p>
            <p>She is battling established energy companies and the Chinese
state grid. But so far 1,300 Berliners have invested cash in the
venture. Arwen wants to build a grid that can better handle the
rise of green power.</p>
            <p>"The most important thing with distribution is that you have
renewables flooding the grid directly," she says.</p>

            <p>"You have to balance incoming and outgoing energy.</p>
            <p>"That's something the structure has to accommodate, and these
structures are old, and they have to be rebuilt from the bottom up
to cope with this bi-directional energy flow."</p>
            <p>Across the city, at a newly built apartment block overlooking
the headquarters of Germany's secret service, Annette Jensen has
just moved in to her new home.</p>
            <p>It is one of the first passive houses in Berlin where curbing
the use of energy is literally built into the fabric of the
building.</p>
            <p>Insulation is critical and air intake is carefully controlled.
Warm air from the kitchens and showers passes through a heat
exchanger and up to 90% of it is recovered.</p>
            <p>Annette says the system works well, and is extremely
economical.</p>

            <p>"We will have to pay around 300 euros a year for our energy
bills; normally people pay 100 euros a month," she explained.</p>
            <p>"I don't sacrifice my comfort, that's not the way to the future
- you don't have to miss anything."</p>
            <p>But all these astonishing strides are coming at a high cost.
Consumers pay directly for green energy through their bills. This
year <a href="http://www.bdew.de/internet.nsf/id/20121015-pi-en?open&amp;ccm=900010020010">
around 50% of an average bill</a> will be made up of taxes and
levies for renewables.</p>
            <p>Critics of the <em>energiewende</em> have dubbed it the "energy
bender", a play on the German pronunciation. They say the plan is
economic madness, with bill payers spending 18bn euros
(Ã‚Â£15bn; $23bn) every year on electricity
with a market value of 3bn euros (Ã‚Â£2.8bn;
$3.8bn).</p>
            <p>"I think the hangover from the energy bender for us is that we
have to pay for our extremely ambitious extension of renewables for
years and years," says Florian Rentsch, minister for economics in
the region of Hesse.</p>

            </div>
            <p>"The law on renewable energy will not only lead to increased
electricity prices, but it is also a non-market, planned system
that endangers the industrial base of our economy."</p>
            <p>This view is supported by Prof Colin Vance from the German
economic research institute <a href="http://en.rwi-essen.de/">RWI</a>.</p>
            <p>"I definitely think there will be a cost hangover with it," he
said.</p>
            <p>"The least competitive renewable energy is getting the most
support. There is a certain insanity to it, yes.</p>
            <p>"By our calculations, we estimate that for solar power alone, it
is more than 100 billion euros over 20 years."</p>
            <p>As well as growing concerns about the cost, there are worries
that the financial incentives have brought too many renewable
sources to the market at the same time.</p>
            <p>Germany is not a country known for its exposure to the Sun.
However, the scale of installed solar capacity means that on a
bright day, the country is overwhelmed with sunny electricity.</p>

            <p>On 16 June this year, <a href="http://renewable-energy-industry.com/press-releases/press-releases_detail.php?newsid=4514&amp;changeLang=en_GB">
solar and wind energy combined</a> to produce 60% of Germany's
power needs. So much solar was coming into the grid that wholesale
prices on that afternoon were, for a time, in the negative.</p>
            <p>For the big utility companies, this is a nightmare scenario.
Their business model means they recoup their investments in large
gas- and coal-fired power stations by a steady demand for their
electricity over a long period of time.</p>
            <p>But because the feed-in tariff gives small renewable producers
priority access to the grid, the big boys can only make money when
the Sun doesn't show and the wind doesn't blow.</p>
            <p>On days like 16 June, expensive gas-fired power plants stood
idly by while the solar cells sizzled.</p>
            <p>To curb their costs, these corporations have turned to the
cheapest possible electricity sources - including brown coal or
lignite, which is one of the most carbon-intensive fuels.</p>
            <p>Because of this, Germany's CO2 emissions <a href="http://phys.org/news/2013-02-german-greenhouse-gas-emissions-rose.html">
went up in 2012</a>, despite renewables never having a larger share
of the market. The fossil-fuel energy producers are demanding
change.</p>

            <p>"At the moment, the energy transition is at a crossroads," says
Peter Englehard from RWE, one of Germany's big four utility
companies.</p>
            <p>"It is driven by subsidies and administrative intervention,
where it should be more market-based. We have to bring more market
into this, otherwise it will drown in too much subsidised
power."</p>
            <p>There is general political support for the <em>energiewende</em>
amongst the major political parties.</p>
            <p>The German government has ambitious targets for cutting overall
energy consumption by around 40% by 2050. In the plan, renewables
will make up half the electricity supply, and a third of total
energy, including transport, by 2030.</p>
            <p>But there is also an emerging consensus that there should be
changes to cut the costs of the programme.</p>
            <p>Minister Rentsch, whose party is in the governing Federal
coalition, says that changes are necessary and likely to take place
after the general election in September.</p>
            <p>"If the energy prices for the transition will increase in the
next years, I think the <em>energiewende</em> will lose acceptance
in our society," he argues.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Wind farms have benefited from high subsidies paid
directly by the consumer</span>
            </div>
            <p>But with strong financial support in place until the middle of
the 2020s, politicians, consumers and even utility companies say
there is no going back.</p>
            <p>And according to Dr Ralf Fuecks, the head of the Heinrich Boell
foundation in Berlin, the transition has not just changed the
energy supply, it has changed attitudes to consumption as well.</p>
            <p>"It is not about going backwards - green is not about departing
from the modern lifestyle," he says.</p>
            <p>"We are progressing into a moral economy. Morality is not a
contradiction to economic success. It is the other way around."</p>

            <p>Germany has a long history of environmental activism and this
has helped spark the massive energy transformation known as the
<em>energiewende</em>.</p>
            <p>The first step was the Renewable Energy Sources Act, which came
into force back in the year 2000. This set up the system of
guaranteed payments called feed-in tariffs, giving small-scale
producers of green energy a fixed amount for a period of 20
years.</p>
            <p>The second key element was the disaster at Fukushima in 2011.
The German government did a rapid U-turn on nuclear energy,
immediately ordering a speeding up of the phasing out of this
important source of energy. They also changed the law to give small
producers priority access to the grid, something they say is more
important than the guaranteed price.</p>
