            </div>
            <p class="introduction">US President Barack
Obama has toured Robben Island - the jail in which Nelson Mandela
was kept for 18 years.</p>
            <p>He said he and his family were "deeply humbled" to visit the
prison once inhabited by Mr Mandela - who remains critically ill in
hospital.</p>
            <p>Mr Obama went on to give a speech at the University of Cape Town
and launch a multi-billion-dollar electricity initiative.</p>
            <p>The US leader did not visit Mr Mandela, but met the Mandela
family in private.</p>
            <p>Security was stepped up during this final Cape Town leg of his
time in South Africa, following clashes on Saturday between riot
police and anti-Obama protesters in Soweto.</p>
            <p>Mr Obama and the first family visited Mr
Mandela's bleak cell as well as the lime quarry - overlooked by a
concrete watchtower - where anti-apartheid fighters including Mr
Mandela were forced to undertake hours of back-breaking labour.</p>
            <p>Mr Mandela was at the prison for 18 years and his long history
of lung problems can be traced to the tuberculosis he contracted
there - which he attributed to the dampness of his cell.</p>
            <p>Later, Mr Obama wrote in the guest book in the prison courtyard:
"On behalf of our family, we're deeply humbled to stand where men
of such courage faced down injustice and refused to yield.</p>
            <p>"The world is grateful for the heroes of Robben Island, who
remind us that no shackles or cells can match the strength of the
human spirit."</p>
            <p>Mr Obama also visited a community project before delivering a
keynote address at the University of Cape Town.</p>
            <p>It was the same venue where 47 years ago, US Senator Robert
Kennedy gave his famed "ripple of hope" speech, which gave
inspiration to those fighting the racially divisive policies of
apartheid rule and linked their struggle with that of the US civil
rights movement.</p>
            <p>Mr Obama paid tribute to South Africa's achievements over the
past two decades but urged young Africans to fulfil Mr Mandela's
legacy.</p>
            <p>"Nelson Mandela showed us that one man's courage can move the
world,'' he said.</p>
            <p>More needed to be done to tackle poverty and disease, he said,
adding that fear too often prevailed in Africa. For as long as war
raged, democracy and economic opportunity could not take hold, he
said.</p>
            <p>Mr Obama also announced a $7bn
(Ã‚Â£4.6bn) five-year initiative to double
access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa, in partnership with
African countries and the private sector.</p>
            <p>Mr Obama arrived in South Africa from Senegal on Friday. On
Monday, he is travelling to Tanzania, the final stage of his
African tour.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Mr Mandela's grandson, Mandla, has said he will oppose
a court action brought by the rest of the family, seeking to exhume
the bodies of his father, Makgatho, two of Nelson Mandela's
daughters and two other relatives.</p>
            <p>The rest of the family want the remains to be reburied in Qunu,
where the former South African president wants to be laid to rest,
while Mandla, an ANC MP, wants them to stay in the nearby village
of Mvezo, Nelson Mandela's birthplace, where he is building a
museum dedicated to his grandfather.</p>
            <p>South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper quotes local chiefs in the
area as saying that Madiba, as Nelson Mandela is known in the
country, will not be at peace until this issue is resolved.</p>
            <p>On Friday, a court granted an interim action saying the bodies
could be exhumed and reburied but Mandla Mandela says he was not
aware of the case until it was reported in the media and he is now
opposing it.</p>

            <p>More than three weeks after Nelson Mandela was taken to
Medi-Clinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria, there is still a steady
stream of well-wishers leaving flowers and tributes to add to the
huge collection outside the gates.</p>
            <p>On Sunday morning, two church groups were singing hymns, while
veterans from Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the ANC's armed wing set up
by Mr Mandela, arrived with a portrait of their founder wearing a
military uniform.</p>
            <p>The tributes come from around the world - Pakistan, Mexico and
France - as well as several African countries. And in a testimony
to Mr Mandela's dream of creating a rainbow nation, all of South
Africa's racial groups were represented.</p>
            <p>As she left a bunch of white chrysanthemums, Raksha Daya said
that like many South Africans, she connects with the former
president on a deeply personal level, like a grandfather. "It's a
sense of love."</p>
