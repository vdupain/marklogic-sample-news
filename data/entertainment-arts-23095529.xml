will be starring in the new film</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The latest
instalment in the Terminator franchise will be the first in a
stand-alone "rebooted" trilogy.</p>
            <p>Paramount Pictures said the fifth Terminator film, based on the
original series starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is due to be
released in June 2015.</p>
            <p>There was no official confirmation on who would direct or star
in the forthcoming film.</p>
            <p>However Schwarzenegger revealed <a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/06/14/arnold-schwarzenegger-terminator-5/">
earlier this month</a> he would be returning to the role that made
him a household name.</p>
            <p>Speaking at an event in Sydney, Australia, the former governor
of California said: "I'm very happy that the studios want me to be
in Terminator 5 and to star as the Terminator, which we start
shooting in January."</p>
            <p>Schwarzenegger starred in the first three Terminator films -
released in 1984, 1991 and 2003 - which grossed more than $1bn
(Ã‚Â£655m) at the global box office.</p>
            <p>A computer-generated version of the actor appeared in 2009's
Terminator Salvation, which starred Christian Bale and Sam
Worthington.</p>
            <p>The new film will be penned by Shutter Island screenwriter Laeta
Kalogridis and Drive Angry's Patrick Lussier.</p>
            <p>With a release date scheduled for 26 June, the movie will join a
slew of summer blockbusters, coming out a week before Independence
Day 2 and two weeks ahead of Pirates of the Caribbean 5.</p>
            <p>Star Wars - Episode 7 is also due to be released around the same
time.</p>
