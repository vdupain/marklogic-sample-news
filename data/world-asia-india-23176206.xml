               <p class="caption">Many of India's affluent elderly are moving to
retirement villages</p>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">When KS Shekar's
sons decided to settle down abroad, they invited him to come and
live with them.</p>
            <p>But Mr Shekar had other plans.</p>
            <p>He moved into a comfortable 30-acre, 200-cottage "retirement
village" on the outskirts of India's southern city of Bangalore,
well-known as the country's info-tech capital.</p>
            <p>"I wanted to live
myÃ‚Â retirementÃ‚Â phase
on my own terms and I have no qualms about it. My wife and I love
to read and write, we enjoy nature and love to mix with like-minded
people. If we were staying with the children, our lives would be
governed by their will. This is not on," he says.</p>
            <p>At their plush retirement cottage, flanked by artificial lakes
and with a view of surrounding hills, the couple keep in touch with
their children over Skype.</p>
            <p>"When my parents decided to stay away from us, the feeling of
guilt did creep in. But now I'm glad to see them independent and
happy," Kishore Shekar, who is a doctor in Glasgow, says.</p>
            <p>"My brother and I would never want to take that away from
them."</p>
            <p>Traditionally, children in India have looked after their parents
in their twilight years.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Most elderly in India expect to be
dependent on their children</span>
            </div>
            <p>"Unlike in the West where the elderly dread the thought of being
dependent on their children, the elderly in India expect to be
dependent on their children. Eyebrows are raised if this equation
is not seen in a family," says sociologist Patricia Uberoi.</p>
            <p>But times are slowly changing.</p>
            <p>Mr Shekar and his wife are a part of the growing number of
elderly people who are breaking away from the traditional family
system and staying away from their children, mostly out of
choice.</p>
            <p>This, in turn, has spurred demand for retirement homes that now
dot the outskirts of the main cities.</p>
            <p>Mr Shekar's upscale retirement "village" has emergency medical
services, wheelchairs, a health club, anti-skid flooring and
elderly-friendly bathrooms and a community
kitchen.Ã‚Â Residents
includeÃ‚Â retiredÃ‚Â teachers,
engineers, doctors and company executives.</p>
            <p>"India today has 100 million elderly people. If you take 5% of
them as the middle class, it comes to five million people. It is a
huge number and there's hardly any availability of old-age homes.
So there's a huge market out there for realtors," says A Sridharan,
chief of Covai Senior Care Constructions that builds retirement
homes.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Retirement homes have become popular
among the affluent elderly</span>
            </div>
            <p>Mr Sridharan believes the migration of the elderly to retirement
homes - which can cost anywhere between $14,000
(Ã‚Â£9,333) and $150,000
(Ã‚Â£100,000) - began with the info-tech boom
in the 1990s.</p>
            <p>"A lot of young middle-class Indians left the country during the
boom. Their children don't want to be known as people who have
their parents living in old age homes. So a need for such exclusive
homes was felt and the rising middle-class is securing
itsÃ‚Â retirementÃ‚Â years
by buying exclusiveÃ‚Â homes."</p>
            <p>Mr Shekar says he chose to live in a retirement home because of
"happiness that I share with my wife and friends here".</p>
            <p>"We are a set of like-minded people and love to share jokes and
our life experiences. That's why I chose this life."</p>
