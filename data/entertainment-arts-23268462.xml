               <span style="width:304px;">Jackson died in 2009 before a series of concerts at
the 02 in London</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The director of
Michael Jackson's planned comeback shows, Kenny Ortega, has broken
down in tears while giving evidence at the singer's wrongful death
trial in the US.</p>
            <p>Ortega said Jackson's appearance was "very, very troubling" at a
rehearsal, days before his death in June 2009.</p>
            <p>"I saw a Michael that frightened me," Ortega told the jury.</p>
            <p>The director was giving evidence for a third day in the case
against live event promoter AEG Live.</p>
            <p>The company is being sued by Jackson's mother for $40bn
(Ã‚Â£26bn) over his death.</p>
            <p>Katherine Jackson claims the company failed to properly
investigate her son's personal doctor, Conrad Murray, and missed
warning signs about his failing health as he prepared for his This
Is It tour.</p>
            <p>Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter after giving
Jackson a lethal dose of the anaesthetic propofol in 2009.</p>
            <p>The company has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

               <span style="width:224px;">Director-choreographer, Ortega is the
highest-ranking tour worker to give evidence at the
trial</span>
            </div>
            <p>Ortega told the jury on Wednesday that, based on Jackson's
condition, he didn't believe the This Is It concerts could go
forward.</p>
            <p>He said Jackson appeared to be under the influence of an unknown
substance during at least four rehearsals.</p>
            <p>The director-choreographer said he was under the impression
Jackson's strange behaviour followed visits to his doctor.</p>
            <p>The singer's state was "fairly obvious" to others involved in
the production, he added.</p>
            <p>Jackson also missed several scheduled rehearsals, said Ortega,
adding that during a session six days before his death, he was
cold, shivering and seemed lost.</p>
            <p>Ortega, 63, told the court that Jackson improved somewhat as the
night went on but wasn't coherent when he arrived that day. The
singer didn't rehearse that night.</p>
            <p>Reading an email he sent to the CEO of concert promoter AEG Live
hours after the rehearsal, Ortega shed tears as he described
Jackson as a "lost boy".</p>
            <p>The director said he sent the email to alert AEG officials about
Jackson's condition and trusted them to get the singer appropriate
care.</p>
            <p>He said he repeatedly called Murray that night, "the doctor who
I thought would be the most natural person" to help.</p>
            <p>"Then I reached out to AEG, Michael's partners, to make sure
they were aware of how I felt and what I saw," he added.</p>
            <p>Ortega outlined a tense meeting with Murray the following day,
during which Murray assured him and AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips
that Jackson was capable of rehearsing.</p>
            <p>AEG has denied it hired Murray and said there was no way it
could have known the doctor was giving Jackson propofol as a sleep
aid.</p>
            <p>Ortega - who directed the High School musical trilogy - is the
highest-ranking tour worker to give evidence at the trial and had
the most direct contact with AEG executives and Jackson.</p>
            <p>The trial, currently in its 11th week, is expected to last until
the end of July.</p>
