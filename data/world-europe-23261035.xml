bailout deal, warns President Cavaco Silva</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Portuguese President
Anibal Cavaco Silva has rejected opposition parties' demands for an
early election.</p>
            <p>"The current government has all the authority to exercise its
functions," he said in a televised address.</p>
            <p>He also urged all main parties to reach a compromise that would
allow Portugal to see out its bailout period next year without
needing a second bailout.</p>
            <p>Portugal was plunged into political crisis when the finance and
foreign ministers resigned last week.</p>
            <p>Vitor Gaspar was seen as the architect of austerity and quit
because of a lack of support for his approach.</p>
            <p>Foreign Minister Paulo Portas was unhappy with the extent of the
austerity measures needed to comply with the conditions set in the
78bn euros ($102bn; Ã‚Â£67bn) bailout received
in May 2011.</p>
            <p>The austerity cuts are widely blamed for keeping Portugal in
recession over the past two years, angering trade unions and
left-wing parties and causing a wave of street protests.</p>
            <p>On Sunday, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho put together a
deal between his Social Democratic party and its junior partner,
the centre-right Popular Party (CDS-PP).</p>
            <p>In his televised statement, President Cavaco Silva did not give
explicit backing to the government reshuffle, which involves CDS-PP
leader Paulo Portas coming back into the cabinet as deputy prime
minister.</p>
            <p>But he said adhering to opposition demands for early elections
would be "extremely negative" for Portugal's credibility - which he
said had been hit by the finance and foreign ministers'
resignations with one year left before the end of Portugal's
bailout terms.</p>
            <p>He instead urged the ruling coalition parties to put aside their
differences and reach a broad agreement with the opposition
Socialists on holding elections after Portugal exits the bailout
period.</p>
            <p>"I will give my firm support to this deal, which in the current
context of emergency truly represents a commitment of national
salvation," he said.</p>
            <p>This was, he said, essential to reduce the risk of Portugal's
having to seek a second bailout.</p>
            <p>After two years of recession, unemployment stands at over 17.5%,
with thousands of more highly educated people seeking work
abroad.</p>
            <p>The economy is expected to contract by 2.3% this year.</p>
