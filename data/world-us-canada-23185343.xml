            <p class="introduction">The Statue of
Liberty, shut last year after a huge storm, has reopened to the
public as Americans everywhere mark Independence Day.</p>
            <p>Crowds are flocking once again to see the New York monument,
which was swamped by tidal surges during post-tropical cyclone
Sandy in October.</p>
            <p>Events were also held in Boston, Washington, Atlanta,
Philadelphia and New Orleans to mark the US holiday.</p>
            <p>Security precautions will be tight at major parades and
fireworks displays.</p>
            <p>The 46-m (151-ft) Statue of Liberty reopened on Thursday morning
at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by New York's mayor.</p>
            <p>Most of Liberty Island, the attraction's home off lower
Manhattan, was deluged by last autumn's powerful storm.</p>
            <p>Although the 127-year-old Lady Liberty herself was unscathed,
there was widespread damage to her 12-acre (five-hectare) site.</p>
            <p>Railings, docks and paving stones were smashed, while electrical
systems, sewerage and boilers were wrecked.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of National Park Service workers have been cleaning up
the mud and debris, with some repairs still under way.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">In New Jersey, Independence Day
celebrations began a day early</span>
            </div>
            <p>The neighbouring Ellis Island, once the nation's busiest gateway
and home to a famous immigration museum, suffered far worse in the
storm and remains closed.</p>
            <p>The damage to both islands has been estimated at $59m
(Ã‚Â£39m).</p>
            <p>"This to us, Liberty Island, is really about a rebirth," Heather
Leykam, who came to see the statue with her husband and three
children from their home in Brooklyn, told the Associated Press
news agency.</p>
            <p>"It is a sense of renewal for the city and the country."</p>
            <p>New York City staged its annual fireworks display over the
Hudson River with live performances by Taylor Swift and others.</p>
            <p>Across the country, star-spangled bunting was rolled out for
celebrations, picnics and barbecues.</p>
            <p>Boston staged its first major public gathering since the deadly
bombings at the city's marathon on 15 April. Law enforcement
officials have said those blasts were originally intended for 4
July.</p>
            <p>A US national security official told Reuters news agency on
Wednesday that intelligence agencies were unaware of any plot timed
to coincide with the holiday.</p>
            <p>Police used hand-held chemical detectors, radiation scanners and
camera surveillance to screen crowds at some of Thursday's
events.</p>
            <p>In Washington, a 17-minute fireworks display took place on the
National Mall with live music by Barry Manilow and Neil
Diamond.</p>
            <p>Independence Day commemorates the Declaration of Independence on
4 July 1776 from Great Britain during the war of the American
Revolution.</p>
