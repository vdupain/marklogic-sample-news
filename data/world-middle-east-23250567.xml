            <p class="introduction">The main liberal
opposition coalition in Egypt has rejected interim leader Adly
Mansour's decree, which sets a new poll timetable to stop the
unrest.</p>
            <p>The National Salvation Front (NSF) demanded more changes and
consultation on the document.</p>
            <p>Both the Muslim Brotherhood, which supports ousted Islamist
President Mohammed Morsi, and the Tamarod protest movement earlier
rejected the decree.</p>
            <p>The Mansour plan also envisages changes to the Islamist-drafted
constitution.</p>
            <p>In other developments on Tuesday:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Mr Mansour named ex-Finance Minister Hazem el-Beblawi as new
Prime Minister</li>
               <li>in turn, Mr el-Beblawi pledged to give cabinet posts to Muslim
Brotherhood members - an offer immediately rejected by Mohamed
Kamal, senior member of the Brotherhood's political wing, the
Freedom and Justice Party (FJP)</li>
               <li>Defence Minister Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi warned against any
attempts to disrupt the country's "difficult" transition</li>
               <li>two people were killed when suspected Islamists attacked a
security checkpoint in the Sinai province</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Egypt has been in turmoil since the democratically-elected Mr
Morsi was overthrown by the army last week, with protesters both
for and against the ousted president massing on the streets.</p>
            <p>On Monday, at least 51 people - mostly pro-Morsi supporters from
his Muslim Brotherhood movement - were killed outside the barracks
where he is thought to be held.</p>
            <p>"The National Salvation Front announces
its rejection of the constitutional decree," the liberal opposition
said in a statement.</p>
            <p>The NSF said it was not consulted on the document vital to
Egypt's political transition, demanding changes to the
proposal.</p>
            <p>The coalition - which was led by Mohamed ElBaradei until his
appointment as Egypt's deputy president - did not elaborate
further.</p>
            <p>The Muslim Brotherhood - which is pressing for the immediate
reinstatement of Mr Morsi - earlier also rejected the decree.</p>
            <p>Essam al-Erian, deputy chairman of the FJP, said the document
was "a constitutional decree by a man appointed by putschists".</p>
            <p>Even the Tamarod movement - which led the anti-Morsi protests -
said it had not been consulted on the election plan, asking to see
the interim leader to discuss the situation.</p>
            <p>Mr Mansour's decree, issued late on Monday, laid out plans to
set up a panel to amend the suspended Islamist-drafted constitution
within 15 days.</p>
            <p>The changes would then be put to a referendum - to be organised
within four months - which would pave the way for parliamentary
elections, possibly in early 2014.</p>
            <p>Once the new parliament convenes, elections would be called to
appoint a new president.</p>
            <p>Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Sisi said warned in a televised speech
that the "future of the nation is too important and sacred for
manoeuvres or hindrance, whatever the justifications".</p>
            <p>He said that neither the army nor the people of Egypt would
accept "the stalling or disruption" of this "difficult and complex"
period.</p>
            <p>According to the BBC's Wyre Davies, in Cairo, emotions are still
raw and compromise is a word many people are not ready to use.</p>
            <p>Mr Morsi's removal last Wednesday followed days of mass protests
by people who accused him of becoming increasingly authoritarian,
pursuing an Islamist agenda, and failing to tackle Egypt's economic
woes.</p>
            <p>The army's moves were welcomed by some Gulf states, and two -
the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia - have made major pledges
of financial help in a show of support for the new
administration.</p>
            <p>But other nations were strongly against the army's actions -
perhaps the most vocal of which was Turkey.</p>
            <p>In the aftermath of the ousting of Mr Morsi, Turkish Foreign
Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said: "It is unacceptable for a
government, which has come to power through democratic elections,
to be toppled through illicit means and, even more, a military
coup."</p>
