            <p class="introduction">Fighting in
Afghanistan could be stopped "in weeks" if Pakistan told the
Taliban to end the insurgency, the head of the Afghan army has told
the BBC.</p>
            <p>Gen Sher Mohammad Karimi said Pakistan controlled and gave
shelter to Taliban leaders, deliberately unleashing fighters on
Afghanistan.</p>
            <p>Pakistan denies controlling the Taliban and says the comments
are "malign".</p>
            <p>It was one of the Taliban's main supporters from its launch in
1994 until the 2001 fall of the regime.</p>
            <p>Most of the Taliban's leaders reportedly then fled to Pakistan
and the group is still considered to be heavily dependent on the
support of certain elements in the country.</p>
            <p>"The Taliban are under [Pakistan's] control - the leadership is
in Pakistan," Gen Karimi told the BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p004t1s0">Hardtalk
programme</a>.</p>
            <p>"Madrassas have been closed and all the Taliban have been
unleashed to Afghanistan."</p>
            <p>Afghanistan could achieve peace if this was desired by both the
US and Pakistan, said the general.</p>

unleashing Taliban fighters on Afghanistan</span>
            </div>
            <p>"If [Pakistan] put pressure on [Taliban] leadership or convinced
them what to be done, that can help a lot," he added.</p>
            <p>A Nato report leaked in April said Pakistan was aware that
Taliban leaders were taking refuge within its borders.</p>
            <p>But Pakistan consistently denies wielding influence over the
Taliban, saying many militants have based themselves across the
border in Afghanistan's eastern province of Kunar, from where they
are known to have carried out attacks in north-western
Pakistan.</p>
            <p>"The allegations that Pakistan 'controls' the Taliban and has
'unleashed' them on Afghanistan have no basis," a foreign ministry
spokesman said.</p>
            <p>"We reject them categorically. Pakistan has exercised extreme
restraint in the face of highly provocative language used by the
Afghan civil and military officials over the last few months, not
to mention some totally fabricated accusations."</p>
            <p>The spokesman said that such comments reflected "insincerity" on
the part of some elements in the Afghan government and that
Pakistan was fully supportive of the reconciliation process.</p>
            <p>"Pakistan will not be deterred in its efforts to support the
international community's efforts to bring peace and stability to
Afghanistan," he said.</p>
            <p>Securing the long, porous border between the two countries has
long posed a major challenge to the authorities.</p>
            <p>Gen Karimi's comments come at a sensitive time, says the BBC's
Richard Galpin in Islamabad.</p>
            <p>The US is pushing for peace talks with the Taliban as Nato
combat troops continue to withdraw from Afghanistan - a process due
to be completed next year.</p>
            <p>Last month the Taliban opened their first official overseas
office in the Qatari capital, Doha - the first step ahead of the
expected peace talks.</p>
            <p>US and Afghan leaders want the Taliban to join the Afghan
government as a result of the peace process.</p>
            <p>They say peace talks will succeed when the Taliban finally sever
all ties with al-Qaeda, end violence and accept the Afghan
constitution, including its protections for women and
minorities.</p>
            <p>Pakistani officials are adamant that Pakistan's "legitimate
interests" in Afghanistan must be recognised after the withdrawal
of Nato troops.</p>
            <p>The Taliban insist on the complete withdrawal of foreign forces
as a pre-condition to becoming part of a political settlement in
Afghanistan.</p>
