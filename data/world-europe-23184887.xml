Libya</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Malta has called for
assistance from the European Union after rescuing 291 migrants from
a drifting boat.</p>
            <p>The vessel was intercepted by Maltese patrol boats after coming
from Libya.</p>
            <p>Among the 243 men and 48 women on board, at least two had
gunshot wounds and others were nearly unconscious.</p>
            <p>Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat called EU Council President
Herman Van Rompuy to appeal for solidarity, saying the burden of
immigration to the EU should not fall on its smallest member.</p>
            <p>He said he hoped EU neighbours would show the same solidarity to
Malta that it had shown to them when they received bailouts in
recent years, according to a report in the Malta Independent.</p>
            <p>He did not specify what help he was
hoping for.</p>
            <p>He added that while Malta would do its compassionate duty, it
would not leave its doors open wide and "welcome boats from Libya
and elsewhere as if nothing happened".</p>
            <p>"Call us harsh, call us heartless, but we are not pushovers," Mr
Muscat said.</p>
            <p>Seven people from the drifting boat were flown to hospital by
helicopter, while the others were taken ashore by patrol boats.</p>
            <p>It is thought many on board were originally from Eritrea, said
Malta's Home Affairs Minister Manuel Mallia.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the Italian coast guard intercepted a
boat with at least 80 migrants on board off the Italian island of
Lampedusa, which has been inundated with migrants in recent
years.</p>
            <p>The passengers are thought to be Syrians who set out from
Egypt.</p>
            <p>Pope Francis will visit Lampedusa on Monday to visit and pray
for the migrants there, and to lay a wreath in the sea for the many
hundreds who have died trying to reach Europe.</p>
