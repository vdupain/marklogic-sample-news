also made imports more expensive</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Japanese exports rose in May at the fastest
annual rate since 2010 as the yen weakened, providing a boost to
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plan to revive the economy.</p>
            <p>Shipments shot up 10.1% from the previous year, data showed, to
earn 5.8tn yen ($60.5bn; Ã‚Â£39bn).</p>
            <p>The yen has weakened significantly since last year, despite
recent gains, helping exporters.</p>
            <p>A strong yen makes their goods expensive overseas and cuts
profits.</p>
            <p>"This (export data) shows Japanese
companies are increasingly in better shape," said Junko Nishioka,
chief economist at RBS Securities Japan. "Their profitability is
also rising these days, meaning they are becoming more resilient to
potential external shocks."</p>
            <p>Shipments picked up in key markets, with exports to the US
rising 16.3% from a year earlier. Shipments to China increased by
8.3%.</p>
            <p>The yen has lost more than a fifth of its value against the US
dollar in the 12 months to May. Even though it has gained some
strength in recent days, it is still 17% below where it was a year
ago and currently trades at about 95 yen to the dollar.</p>
            <p>Many Japanese firms have said this is the right level for their
exports to recover.</p>

            <p>However, the weak yen has also made
imports more expensive.</p>
            <p>Imports in May were up 10% from a year ago, data showed on
Wednesday, taking the trade deficit to 993.9bn yen.</p>
            <p>It marks the 11th straight month that Japan has posted a deficit
as energy import costs continue to be high after the country's
nuclear plants were shut down.</p>
            <p>Policymakers have embarked on a stimulus effort to pull Japan
out of nearly two decades of economic stagnation.</p>
            <p>The improved data comes after Mr Abe declared that his
aggressive policies aimed at sparking growth had won support from
the G8 leaders on Tuesday.</p>
