            <p class="introduction">Some senior
executives of the Chinese division of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) are
facing a criminal investigation, the Chinese authorities have
said.</p>
            <p>They are being investigated for bribery and tax-related
violations, said the Chinese Ministry of Public Security.</p>
            <p>They are suspected of offering bribes to officials and doctors
in an attempt to boost sales in the country.</p>
            <p>GSK said in response to the allegations that it had found no
evidence of bribery or corruption in China.</p>
            <p>"We are willing to co-operate with the authorities in this
inquiry," the company said in a statement, adding that it had only
just received official word of the "specific nature" of the
investigation.</p>
            <p>"We take all allegations of bribery and corruption seriously,"
the statement said.</p>
            <p>"We continuously monitor our businesses to ensure they meet our
strict compliance procedures - we have done this in China and found
no evidence of bribery or corruption of doctors or government
officials. However, if evidence of such activity is provided, we
will act swiftly on it."</p>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Public Security said in a statement that
police had questioned some of the suspects.</p>
            <p>It accused the firm of bribing government officials and doctors,
as well as overstating tax receipts.</p>
            <p>"The case involves many people, the duration of time is long,
the amount of money involved is huge and the criminal activities
are malicious," the ministry said.</p>
            <p>Senior executives at GSK are already being investigated by
Changsha public security officials for "economic crimes", the
city's police force said last month. However, it is not clear if
the Changsha investigation is related to any of the latest
allegations.</p>
