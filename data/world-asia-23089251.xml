            <p class="introduction">A court in
Bangladesh has sentenced nine people to life in prison for the 2005
murder of journalist Gautam Das.</p>
            <p>Gautam Das was known for his reporting on crime and corruption
is said to have been investigating local officials in Faridpur at
the time of his death.</p>
            <p>The head of the Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists said
many such cases were not properly investigated.</p>
            <p>Bangladesh International Press Institute representative Monjurul
Ahsan Bulbul welcomed the convictions.</p>
            <p>"There is a culture of impunity for the culprits and in that
respect Bangladesh stands in very bad shape," he said.</p>
            <p>Also welcoming the convictions, Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury of the
International Press Institute said many journalists had been killed
in the south-west of Bangladesh over the past 20 years, and as a
result freedom of speech had been seriously compromised.</p>
