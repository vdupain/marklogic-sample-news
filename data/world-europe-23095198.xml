            <p class="introduction">EU leaders have
ended their summit in Brussels by agreeing to put 6bn euros
(Ã‚Â£5bn; $8bn) into youth training schemes
amid record unemployment.</p>
            <p>They also agreed to promote lending to credit-starved small
businesses, using an extra 10bn euros in funding.</p>
            <p>Nearly a quarter of jobseekers aged 18 to 25 in the EU have no
work.</p>
            <p>Critics say the schemes will have little impact until countries
return to growth but Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said they
were a "first step".</p>
            <p>In another development, outlined in the official <a href="http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/137634.pdf">
summit conclusions</a>, EU leaders confirmed they wanted agreement
by the end of the year on a way to wind up failed banks at European
rather than at national level.</p>
            <p>They also approved <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23099379">accession talks
for Serbia</a> by January at the latest, as well as formalising
Croatia's entry into the EU on Monday.</p>
            <p>As of April, some 5.6 million young people eligible for work in
the EU were unemployed, <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-31052013-BP/EN/3-31052013-BP-EN.PDF">
Eurostat figures</a> show.</p>
            <p>Greece had the highest proportion, at 62.5%, while Spain had
56.4%. This contrasted with just 7.5% in Germany.</p>
            <p>The UK's Prime Minister, David Cameron,
said the number of young people out of work in Europe was "frankly
appalling" and a huge block on the EU's ability to compete in the
global race.</p>
            <p>There was, he said, also a need to move faster and further in
cutting excessive regulation and red tape. He said a new business
task force would be established in the UK to take a fresh look at
the impact of EU regulations on British business.</p>
            <p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the key was improving
competitiveness and not creating new pots of money.</p>
            <p>The speaker of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, <a href="https://twitter.com/MartinSchulz">tweeted</a> that the 6bn euros
were a "start", albeit a "drop in the ocean".</p>
            <p>"What we, the current generation of politicians, owe these young
people are good ideas, courage and prompt action - in order to
generate growth at long last," he said in a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/the-president/en/press/press_release_speeches/speeches/sp-2013/sp-2013-june/html/speech-by-the-president-of-the-european-parliament-martin-schulz-to-the-european-council-of-27-june-2013">
speech</a>.</p>
            <p>"After all, the most effective means of creating jobs - and thus
of combating youth unemployment - is economic growth."</p>
            <p>The plan to trigger much-needed bank lending to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) involves using an extra 10bn euros
in funding for the European Investment Bank.</p>
            <p>The idea is to encourage private banks to lend by giving them
EIB guarantees.</p>
            <p>French President Francois Hollande predicted the EU would have a
single banking supervisor, and a mechanism for closing failed
banks, in place by the middle of next year.</p>
            <p>There was relief on Thursday when, after months of wrangling, a
deal was clinched on the EU's long-term budget.</p>
            <p>The 27 leaders backed the deal reached with the European
Parliament - a 960bn-euro budget for 2014-2020, which cuts real
spending for the first time.</p>
            <p>There was a last-minute delay, with Mr Cameron seeking
reassurances that new arrangements on rural development funds would
not lead to Ã‚Â£300m being deducted from the
British rebate - which some French officials had been suggesting.
He was told the rebate would remain unchanged, the BBC's Europe
editor Gavin Hewitt reports.</p>
            <p>Under the new budget deal, unspent money will be transferred
from one year to the next, rather than returning to national
budgets as at present.</p>
