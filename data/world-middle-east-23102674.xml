            <p class="introduction">Two bombs have
killed at least 10 people in Ramadi, western Iraq.</p>
            <p>One bomb went off inside a Sunni militiaman's car, killing him
and other officials, and a second device went off minutes later as
people gathered around the wreckage.</p>
            <p>The attacks come a day after a series of bombings struck cafes
in and around the capital, Baghdad.</p>
            <p>There has been a recent surge in sectarian violence in Iraq,
with last month the bloodiest since June 2008.</p>
            <p>Public places such as mosques, restaurants and local markets
have been singled out for attack.</p>
            <p>One man at the scene of the Friday attacks is quoted as saying
by the Reuters news agency: "We were on duty at a nearby checkpoint
when the car exploded. We ran to work out what was going on, but
before we reached the car it exploded again."</p>
            <p>Many of Friday's victims were members of the Sahwa militias
formed in 2006 to fight al-Qaeda militants.</p>
            <p>Since then, the group has been a target for Sunni insurgents who
consider its members traitors for remaining loyal to the Shia-led
government.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday, a spate of car bomb explosions in Baghdad claimed
more than 30 lives.</p>
            <p>Tensions between Iraq's Shia Muslim majority and minority Sunnis
have been steadily growing since last year.</p>
            <p>Sunnis have accused Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of
discriminating against them - a claim the government denies.</p>
