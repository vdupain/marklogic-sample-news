               <p class="caption">An excerpt of the recording obtained by Exaro
website and broadcast on Channel 4 News</p>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">News Corp has
defended chief Rupert Murdoch after a secret recording was released
of him criticising the police inquiry into alleged inappropriate
payments to officials by journalists.</p>
            <p>Speaking in March to a group of Sun journalists - many of whom
are under investigation - he complains about "totally incompetent"
police officers.</p>
            <p>The recording was obtained by <a href="http://www.exaronews.com/">the Exaro website</a> and aired
<a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/murdoch-rupert-tape-police-the-sun-journalists">
on Channel 4 News.</a>
            </p>
            <p>News Corp said Mr Murdoch had shown "understandable empathy"
with staff.</p>
            <p>Allegations of phone hacking at the now-defunct News of the
World thrust the newspaper's owners, News Corp, and its journalists
directly into the spotlight.</p>
            <p>A separate Scotland Yard investigation, named Operation Elveden,
is looking into claims of inappropriate payments made to police and
other public officials by journalists.</p>
            <p>In the recording, Mr Murdoch is heard
speaking about Operation Elveden.</p>
            <p>"Still, I mean, it's a disgrace," the News Corp boss is heard
saying in the tapes acquired by the Exaro investigative website and
said to have been recorded at the Sun headquarters in Wapping, east
London.</p>
            <p>"Here we are, two years later, and the cops are totally
incompetent.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>'Total support'</strong>
            </p>
            <p>"The idea that the cops then started coming after you, kick you
out of bed, and your families, at six in the morning, is
unbelievable.</p>
            <p>"But why are the police behaving in this way? It's the biggest
inquiry ever, over next to nothing.</p>
            <p>"And now they're arresting their own, who never even took
money... they're going to put all newspapers out of business."</p>
            <p>He also offered his backing to the journalists, even if they
were found guilty.</p>
            <p>"I will do everything in my power to give
you total support, even if you're convicted and get six months or
whatever," he said.</p>
            <p>"You're all innocent until proven guilty."</p>
            <p>A spokesman for News Corp told Channel 4 News: "No other company
has done as much to identify what went wrong, compensate the
victims and ensure the same mistakes do not happen again.</p>
            <p>"The unprecedented co-operation granted by News Corp was agreed
unanimously by senior management and the board, and the MSC [News
Corp management and standards committee] continues to co-operate
under the supervision of the courts.</p>
            <p>"Rupert Murdoch has shown understandable empathy with the staff
and families affected and will assume they are innocent until and
unless proven guilty."</p>
