               <span style="width:304px;">The Vatican bank has been plagued by financial
scandals for decades</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The director and
deputy director of the Vatican bank have resigned following the
arrest of a senior Italian cleric over corruption and fraud
allegations.</p>
            <p>Paolo Cipriani and Massimo Tulli offered to step down on Monday
"in the best interest of the institute and the Holy See'', the
Vatican says.</p>
            <p>It comes three days after the arrest of Monsignor Nunzio
Scarano.</p>
            <p>The 61-year-old and two others are suspected of trying to move
20m euros ($26m; Ã‚Â£17m) illegally.</p>
            <p>Monsignor Scarano, a priest from southern Italy, worked for
years as a senior accountant for a Vatican department known as Apsa
(the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See).</p>
            <p>He has been under investigation by Italian police for a series
of suspicious transactions involving the recycling through the
Vatican bank of a series of cheques described as church
donations.</p>
            <p>The two other men arrested on 28 June have been named as
Giovanni Maria Zito, who is described as an Italian secret service
agent, and Giovanni Carenzio, a financial broker.</p>
            <p>Ernst von Freyberg, the current president of the bank, would
serve as its interim director, taking over from Mr Cipriani, a
Vatican statement said.</p>
            <p>A new position of chief risk officer would also be created to
improve compliance with financial regulations.</p>
            <p>Last week, Pope Francis set up a commission of inquiry to look
into the bank, which has been beset by allegations of money
laundering for decades. He had already named a trusted cleric to
oversee the way the institution had been managed.</p>
            <p>Officially known as the Institute for the Works of Religion
(IOR), the bank is one of the world's most secretive. It has 114
employees and 5.4bn euros of assets.</p>
            <p>The scandal is an embarrassment to the Vatican with Pope Francis
campaigning for the Catholic Church to be closer to the people of
the developing world.</p>
            <p>Some churchmen are even questioning whether the Vatican needs
its own bank, BBC Rome correspondent David Willey reports.</p>
