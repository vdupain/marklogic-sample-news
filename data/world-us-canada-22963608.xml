               <span style="width:304px;">It was the NSA chief's second visit to
Congress since the snooping programmes emerged</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The head of
America's electronic spying agency has told Congress surveillance
programmes leaked by Edward Snowden helped thwart 50 attacks since
2001.</p>
            <p>Army General Keith Alexander, director of the National Security
Agency (NSA), told the House intelligence committee the snooping
operations were critical.</p>
            <p>Plans to attack the New York Stock Exchange were among those
foiled, the panel heard.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Mr Snowden's father urged his son not to commit
"treason".</p>
            <p>It was Gen Alexander's second public appearance before Congress
since the internet and telephone surveillance programmes were
exposed this month.</p>
            <p>"In recent years these programmes, together with other
intelligence, have protected the US and our allies from terrorist
threats across the globe to include helping prevent potential
terrorist events over 50 times since 9/11," he said.</p>
            <p>Ten of those plots had been intended for the US, the panel
heard.</p>
            <p>Sean Joyce, deputy FBI director, told the committee one of the
cases had involved a "nascent" plot to bomb the New York Stock
Exchange.</p>
            <p>Mr Joyce said a tip from the NSA had led the FBI to arrest
Khalid Ouazzani of Kansas City, Missouri, on conspiracy
charges.</p>
            <p>Ouazzani admitted in a federal court in
2010 plotting to provide material support to a terrorist
organisation, but he was not charged with the alleged stock
exchange plot.</p>
            <p>Mr Joyce also said the surveillance had been essential to
disrupting the 2009 conspiracy to bomb the New York City subway,
resulting in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20371785">capture of
that plot's mastermind, Najibullah Zazi</a>.</p>
            <p>Asked what was next for Mr Snowden, Mr Joyce said simply:
"Justice."</p>
            <p>The former NSA contractor fled to Hong Kong shortly before the
scandal broke. His leaks revealed that US agencies had
systematically gathered vast amounts of phone and web data.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday, Google challenged the US government's gagging order
on its internet surveillance programme, citing a constitutional
right to free speech.</p>
            <p>The web firm asked the secretive US Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court to allow it to publish the number of government
requests in the name of national security for data about its
customers.</p>
            <p>Tech firms including Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and Yahoo have
released limited information about the number of surveillance
requests they receive.</p>
            <p>But they are currently not allowed to show the split in numbers
between requests related to national security and to criminal
investigations.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Mr Snowden's father, Lon Snowden, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/17/exclusive-father-edward-snowden-urges-son-to-stop-leaking-come-home/">
urged his son, in an interview with Fox News</a>: "I hope, I pray
and ask that you will not release any secrets that could constitute
treason."</p>
            <p>He also called on his son to come home and "face justice".</p>
            <p>Edward Snowden has vowed to fight any extradition attempts by
the US.</p>
