               <p class="caption">Meet Freddie Parker, a fan of Andy Schleck, who
has spent more than $32,000 to follow this year's tour</p>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The Tour de France
remains one of few global sporting events that you can attend for
nothing - and stand close enough to the competitors to smell their
sweat as they pass.</p>
            <p>With nearly 3,500km (2,175 miles) of open road available,
there's no shortage of space to set up your picnic table and await
not just the race, but also the carnival of sponsors' floats that
precedes it.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, cycling fans have made their own way, planning
their trip according to their budget and transport, from bicycle
touring to motor homes. Some have even attempted to hitch-hike
their way around the race on as little as a euro a day.</p>
            <p>Finding accommodation in or near locations already swamped with
the race entourage can require planning and reserving, as far in
advance as the preceding October, when the race route is
announced.</p>
            <p>Getting the cheapest prices on travel also involves being
willing and able to pounce as soon as journeys become available,
many months in advance.</p>
            <p>For a growing number of fans travelling from Anglophone
countries, these logistical challenges, combined with the language
barrier, have provided specialist companies with plenty of
opportunity to capitalise on the three-week event.</p>
            <p>With 20 years' experience running cycling trips, Sports Tours
International claims to be one of the biggest players in the
market.</p>

                 alt="Some Sports Tours International customers on the road at the TDF in 2012"/>
               <span style="width:304px;">Sports Tours International is one of the
firms offering Tour de France packages</span>
            </div>
            <p>Across the three weeks of the Tour, it offers packages ranging
from a 12-day, Ã‚Â£2,000 trip, covering the
last 10 or 11 days of the race, to two-night coach trips to Paris
for the final weekend, costing from
Ã‚Â£349.</p>
            <p>The numbers can vary from hundreds in the opening week to
"thousands" in the climactic final week. A key component for about
half of all customers is being able to bring their own bike and
ride sections of the race route, as well as riding to find the
prime spot to see the race.</p>
            <p>"On stages, you don't want to be at the start and finish, you
want to be on the most exciting mountain, where you have access to
the best vantage point. Some of the people ride from the hotel,
others might take the coach and walk, or a mixture of the three,"
says Brendan Fox, Sports Tours International's head of commercial
operations.</p>
            <p>"We might spend three or four nights in the same hotel, which
has access to many stages, and then move on. Logistically, it is
quite complex."</p>
            <p>Thanks to the relationships the company has developed with
hoteliers, it can sometimes get priority in the fight for the last
remaining rooms in a town welcoming Le Tour.</p>
            <p>At every stage start and finish, you can find fans massed around
the team vehicles, hoping for a glimpse of their favourite riders,
the chance of an autograph or a piece of team merchandise, caps and
water bottles being immensely popular. Some will even hunt out the
team hotels in the evening, in the hope of meeting their
heroes.</p>
            <p>As Chris Froome's Team Sky discovered when they tried putting an
<a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/brailsford-sky-must-avoid-isolated-and-robotic-approach">
opaque screen around the riders' warm-up area</a> in 2010, fans see
the freedom to watch and engage with the riders as they prepare as
central to cycling's appeal, not an aspect that can be dictated to
them by the teams.</p>
            <div class="caption body-width">

               <span style="width:464px;">Cycling fans are keen to get as close as
possible to their idols</span>
            </div>
            <p>At the team bus in Nice, several hours before the stage began,
there was already a crowd of fans waiting for the riders, with a
transparent screen in place only at one end of the preparation
area.</p>
            <p>Trek Travel originated in 2003, as part of manufacturer Trek
Bicycle, the firm that sponsored now-disgraced cyclist Lance
Armstrong at the height of his popularity.</p>
            <p>It was spun off as a separate business in 2006. It derives its
cachet from being an official partner of the event and being able
to guarantee access to Trek-sponsored teams and riders.</p>
            <p>The predominantly American group we met in Nice relished the
opportunity to explore the Radio Shack Leopard Trek bus, talk with
team staff and meet star riders including the 2010 winner, Andy
Schleck, at the team's hotel.</p>
            <p>This comes at a hefty premium, with its clientele paying $7,499
(Ã‚Â£5,000) for a six-day itinerary based
around the opening four stages of the race. A ride in a team
vehicle costs an additional $1,000.</p>
            <p>For some of the group, the trip was a one-off for various
reasons: a birthday present; a father-and-son bonding opportunity;
a significant anniversary celebration.</p>
            <p>Freddy Parker, an aircraft mechanic from California, had taken
advantage of unused home equity credit to fund his three-week "trip
of a lifetime" to see the whole race. A bike race fan since 1987,
his being at the Tour represented a lifetime ambition.</p>

            <p>"From where I'm from in Nicaragua, Central America, I don't
think many people get to come here and see this, something special,
especially being its 100th edition," he says.</p>
            <p>As he pressed against the barriers to get the best view and
photo of the riders as they hurtled past, his emotions were the
same as any other spectator along the route of cycling's biggest
event.</p>
            <p>"Just being here, seeing the riders, the race - even if it's for
a few seconds - being in the same town and same locations, that's
the exciting part for me."</p>
            <p>But few will make the financial commitment he has made to follow
the entire race. "So far it's cost me $32,000
(Ã‚Â£21,000), not including expenses," he
admits.</p>
            <p>Watching Freddy as he explored the team bus and met his
favourite rider, Andy Schleck, the price seemed the furthest thing
from his mind. He seemed lost in the moment and as excited as the
children ahead of him in the line to get a signed cap and a photo
with Schleck.</p>
            <p>Over dinner, he talked with evident emotion about how much being
able to speak to Schleck and wish him luck in the race meant to
him, as someone who had dreamt of a career as a professional. The
story was one he said he would remember for the rest of his life
and one he was certain to share with friends and family.</p>
            <p>For some, the financial cost of such a moment of happiness seems
well worth paying. And for the millions who will joyfully line the
route throughout July, the spectacle of the Tour de France passing
remains remarkably free to watch, as it has done throughout the
preceding 99 editions.</p>
