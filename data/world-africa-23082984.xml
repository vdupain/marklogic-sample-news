committee to oversee reforms in the Malian military</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">The military chief
who led the coup that destabilised Mali last year has apologised to
the country.</p>
            <p>Captain Amadou Sanogo said he wanted "to ask for forgiveness
from Malians as a whole" during a reconciliation ceremony between
rival army factions.</p>
            <p>He headed the forces that overthrew the regime of President
Amadou Toumani Toure in March 2012.</p>
            <p>Political and economic instability followed. French intervention
came in January against an Islamist advance.</p>
            <p>International troops moved to tackle al-Qaeda militants and
their allies who took advantage of the chaos to take control of the
country's vast northern desert region.</p>
            <p>The coup also caused a rift between pro-junta soldiers and those
loyal to the former president.</p>
            <p>The event on Wednesday, which aimed to heal the split, was
attended by Mali's interim President Dioncounda Traore.</p>
            <p>Mr Traore announced that all the soldiers arrested after trying
to stage a counter-coup in May 2012 had been released.</p>
            <p>France began a gradual withdrawal of its troops in April,
handing over to a regional African force set up to help the Malian
army provide security.</p>
            <p>But Islamist militants have been leading guerrilla-style attacks
and there have also been clashes between the army and Tuareg
rebels, who captured the northern town of Kidal after the
French-led offensive.</p>
            <p>Last week, the Tuareg rebels signed a peace deal intended to
help pave the way for elections on 28 July.</p>
            <p>The United Nations Security Council has agreed that a UN
peacekeeping force of 12,600 troops should be deployed in Mali from
1 July which will incorporate the 6,000 West African soldiers
already in the country.</p>
            <p>The force will aim to provide security for the election and
France has said it will keep between 3,000 and 3,500 troops on the
ground until then.</p>
