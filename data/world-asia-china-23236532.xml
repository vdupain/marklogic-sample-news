               <span style="width:304px;">The "free-coal" policy was in effect
north of the Huai River in 1950-1980</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">China's policy of
giving free coal for heating to residents in the north has
contributed to shaving 5.5 years off life expectancy there, a study
says.</p>
            <p>It says air pollution from burning coal in the area north of the
Huai River, with a population of some 500m people, was 55% higher
than in the south.</p>
            <p>The region also had higher rates of heart and lung disease as a
result of the policy in force up to 1980.</p>
            <p>The study was conducted by researchers from China, the US and
Israel.</p>
            <p>They studied pollution and deaths in 90 cities in the north and
south between 1981 and 2000.</p>
            <p>They specifically looked at the increase in a type of pollution
called total suspended particulates (TSPs) found in soot and
smoke.</p>
            <p>The researchers then analysed mortality statistics in 1991-2000
and found evidence of shorter life expectancy in the previously
"free coal" areas.</p>
            <p>"Life expectancies are about 5.5. years lower in the north owing
to an increased incidence of cardio-respiratory mortality," said
the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.</p>
            <p>"The analysis suggests that the Huai River policy, which had the
laudable goal of providing indoor heat, had disastrous consequences
for health."</p>
            <p>The scientists argued that their findings may help other
emerging economies - such as Brazil or India - to find better ways
to combine a drive for economic growth and public health
protection.</p>
            <p>The report's findings will increase pressure on the Chinese
authorities to do more to tackle pollution, the BBC's Martin
Patience in Beijing reports.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, the government faced a public outcry after
air pollution soared past levels considered hazardous by the World
Health Organization, our correspondent says.</p>
