            <p class="introduction">In the annals of human folly, it is
doubtful if blood and cash have ever been splashed over anything
quite so fabulous and frivolous as Faberge eggs.</p>
            <p>The story of these diamond-festooned treasures, the glorified
Easter eggs of the Russian tsars, is one of imperial might,
revolution and assassination.</p>

                 alt="15th anniversary Faberge egg"/>
               <span style="width:304px;">The exquisite jewelled eggs were annual
Easter gifts to family members from the Russian tsar</span>
            </div>
            <p>It is also the story of the ambition and incalculable riches of
the new rulers of Russia and the oligarchs.</p>
            <p>The jeweller and entrepreneur Carl Faberge fashioned his
eponymous eggs from gems and precious metals in his St Petersburg
workshop.</p>
            <p>The first one was presented by Tsar Alexander III to his wife,
the Empress Maria Fedorovna, at Easter in 1885, an annual tradition
which his son Nicholas II followed with eggs for his mother and
wife each Easter Sunday.</p>
            <p>Of the approximately 50 eggs made for the imperial family
between 1885 and 1916, 42 have survived.</p>
            <p>In a strong room in south London I set eyes on four of the
eye-popping baubles, made for a ruler who in his day was one of the
most powerful men on Earth.</p>
            <p>The last time one came on the market, in 2007, it fetched
Ã‚Â£9m.</p>
            <p>So as I touched them I willed them not to slip out of my
perspiration-slicked palms.</p>
            <p>The baubles I was nervously fumbling now belong to Viktor
Vekselberg, an oil and gas tycoon who has a fortune estimated at
$18bn (Ã‚Â£11.5bn) and is often described as
Russia's richest man.</p>
            <p>In 2004 he paid $100m for nine imperial eggs - a collection
second only in size to the 10 held by the Kremlin Armoury Museum in
Moscow.</p>
            <p>Enchanted by the novelties disgorged by the eggs - one cracked
in two to reveal a miniature working replica of the Russian state
coach - I began to see how plutocrats like Mr Vekselberg have been
beguiled by the tsar's unsurpassable bling.</p>

               <p class="caption">Russian tycoon Viktor Vekselberg on why he buys
imperial Faberge eggs rather than football clubs</p>
            </div>
            <p>When the harvests failed and hunger stalked the tsar's vast
empire in the early 20th century, the ever-more-ornate eggs
presented at court were history's booby prize for a ruling dynasty
which had grown hopelessly out of touch.</p>
            <p>Nor did Faberge and his sumptuous wares protect the ruling
Romanov line from their tragic end.</p>
            <p>It is claimed that after the Russian revolution the Romanov
women sewed them into their clothes to protect against theft and
the rounds of the Bolshevik firing squad pinged harmlessly off
them. But they were run through with bayonets instead.</p>
            <p>As for Faberge himself, one of the most far-sighted men ever to
squint through a jeweller's eyepiece, he was publicly denounced as
a "profiteer".</p>
            <p>He fled to Western Europe with almost nothing to show for his
years as the tsar's favourite. His son, Agathon, fared even worse.
He was snatched from his mansion outside St Petersburg and held
prisoner in the Kremlin, where he was made to value the hoard of
the Romanovs and their court, for a fire sale to Western
speculators.</p>

            </div>
            <p>And that is where the story of Faberge and his gorgeous,
ludicrous ornaments might have ended but for the morbidly
intoxicating combination of rare jewellery stained with imperial
blood.</p>
            <p>The provenance of the Easter gifts made them irresistible to men
like the rich American collector Malcolm Forbes, founder of Forbes'
magazine. He acquired nine eggs, which in turn were snapped up
after his death by Mr Vekselberg.</p>
            <p>Mr Vekselberg granted me a rare interview in Moscow to talk
about his collection and his project to return the eggs to Mother
Russia - the four that I handled in London were in transit between
exhibitions.</p>
            <p>I began by asking him whether he thought it was worth spending
so much money on nine imperial eggs.</p>
            <p>"If you ask me what is the real valuation, what is the real
price of that, really for me it is very difficult for me to say to
you what it is," he said.</p>
            <p>When I mentioned the fact that fellow Russian magnate Roman
Abramovich had chosen to spend millions on a British football team
- Chelsea - he said: "I don't see any negative to any rich
Russians, any rich men, buying a football club - why not?"</p>
            <p>But he would rather invest in Faberge than football and says the
eggs are not personal trophies but part of his country's proud
legacy.</p>
            <p>"Faberge eggs - this is part of Russian history and Russian
culture," he told me.</p>
            <p>Mr Vekselberg has created a cultural foundation, the Link of
Times, to look after his art. One of the foundation aims is to
repatriate cultural artefacts lost by Russia in the 20th
century.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">The ever more ornate eggs came to be a
symbol of a ruler hopelessly out of touch</span>
            </div>
            <p>Many of the artworks of pre-Soviet Russia collected by Mr
Vekselberg were despised as the playthings of the ruling class. But
now they are seen as part of the storied heritage of a Russian
state rediscovering her history.</p>
            <p>I asked Mr Vekselberg if Russia's President Vladimir Putin had
thanked him for buying back Faberge eggs.</p>
            <p>"Yes, I see that it is emotional for our president and very
important that a Russian citizen brought back this huge
collection," he said.</p>
            <p>"Russia has a huge story, with a lot of artefacts, a big
culture, and this is a piece of that," he added.</p>
            <p>But the historical irony is not lost on him that a wealthy,
remote elite are once again the masters in Moscow.</p>
            <p>"If you compare with the situation in Russia 25 years ago, in
socialist times, then everyone was of course equal... We broke one
system and we have just started on a new system," Mr Vekselberg
said.</p>
            <p>"Of course we have some negative results of that transition
system - we have a big gap between a small group of rich men and
the biggest part of the population, who are not so wealthy, but
this is a process and I believe this gap will be reduced," he
said.</p>
