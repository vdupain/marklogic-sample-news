            <p class="introduction">Wales could become
the only UK country with an opt-out organ donation system if
politicians vote to change the law.</p>
            <p>The Welsh government wants to introduce a system where
individuals will be presumed to have consented for their organs to
be donated after death unless they have specifically objected.</p>
            <p>But opponents want families to be able to stop a donation if
their relative did not express an opinion either way.</p>
            <p>Ministers want to increase the number of donors for transplant
by a quarter.</p>
            <p>There has been opposition to the changes from Christian churches
and from within the Muslim and Jewish communities.</p>
            <p>It would mean a change from the current opt-in system, where
would-be donors have to sign a register.</p>

            </div>
            <p>A statement from faith leaders and health professionals - signed
by the Archbishop of Wales Dr Barry Morgan and others - calls for a
so-called "soft opt-out scheme" in the Human Transplantation
Bill.</p>
            <p>They say it would give deceased patients' families a say on
donation if their relative had neither opted in or out.</p>
            <p>A joint statement says that failure to make changes to the bill
would be "inhuman, unfeeling before the suffering of relatives, and
a danger to the public trust and support which are necessary for
the practice of organ donation to flourish".</p>
            <p>If passed by assembly members on Tuesday,
the presumed consent system could come into force by 2015.</p>
            <p>The Welsh government hopes legislation will lead to a rise in
the numbers of donors.</p>
            <p>As currently happens, organs could go to recipients anywhere in
the UK, not just in Wales, although evidence from other countries
with an opt-out system indicates that the rise is small with around
15 additional donors provided each year and approximately 45 extra
organs.</p>
            <p>According to the NHS Blood and Transplant service, fewer than
5,000 people die every year in the UK in circumstances that would
allow them to donate successfully.</p>
            <p>Added to that, when compatibility, organ suitability, location,
time scales and consent are taken into account it means that not
everyone who wants to donate actually does.</p>
            <p>It is estimated there are around 250 people on a waiting list
for a transplant at any one time - 33 people in Wales died in
2012/13 whilst waiting.</p>
            <p>Health Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Wales: "The legislation
makes it absolutely clear that if you are uncomfortable with being
an organ donor you have an absolute right in the simplest way
possible to opt out of the system.</p>
            <p>"You put your name on the organ donor register saying you don't
want to be a donor and that is the end of the matter.</p>
            <p>"There is nothing to be scared of in this legislation."</p>
            <p>The presumed consent law would apply to over-18s who die in
Wales if they have lived in Wales for more than 12 months.</p>

            </div>
            <p>People will be able to sign up to the organ donor register so
their wishes will be known if they die outside Wales.</p>
            <p>If the law is changed, ministers will
have a duty to publicise the system and almost
Ã‚Â£8m will be spent over 10 years.</p>
            <p>The bill would involve transferring some powers from the UK
government to Welsh ministers.</p>
            <p>The Kidney Wales Foundation (KWF) has campaigned for a law
change on organ donation and described the bill as "progressive
law".</p>
            <p>Roy Thomas, KWF chief executive, said: "The Welsh government has
seen this bill scrutinised properly and several detailed
consultations have been undertaken with the Welsh public.</p>
            <p>"This law is further progress and evidence shows it will
increase donation rates."</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland a public consultation is under
way about adopting an opt-out system. In Scotland, ministers have
said the option was "not completely off the agenda" but they have
argued that progress has been made under the current system.</p>
            <p>The Department of Health said a taskforce had recommended
against moving to an opt-out system for England in 2008.</p>
            <p>A spokesman added: "We are working closely with the Welsh
government to ensure their policy does not negatively impact on our
work to promote voluntary organ donations."</p>
