               <span style="width:304px;">South Africa is preparing to celebrate
Nelson Mandela's 95th birthday on 18 July</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Nelson Mandela is
responding to treatment but remains in a critical condition, South
African President Jacob Zuma said after visiting him.</p>
            <p>The former president and global statesman, 94, has been in
hospital battling a recurring lung infection since 8 June.</p>
            <p>President Zuma's <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/pebble.asp?relid=15708">statement</a>
urged the public to continue "providing support and showering him
with love".</p>
            <p>People who have seen him say he remains responsive.</p>
            <p>"We are encouraged that Madiba is responding to treatment," said
President Zuma, referring to Mr Mandela by his clan name.</p>
            <p>The head of Mr Mandela's Thembu tribe, King Buyelekhaya
Dalindyebo, told the AFP news agency on Wednesday that he was
"conscious" when he visited his hospital in Pretoria.</p>
            <p>"He could not talk, but he recognised me and made a few gestures
of acknowledgement, like moving his eyes," he said.</p>
            <p>Last week, President Zuma denied reports that Mr Mandela was in
a vegetative state.</p>

looking better... he showed a sign of response."</p>
            </div>
            <p>Mr Mandela is revered across the world for his role in the fight
against white minority rule in South Africa.</p>
            <p>He was jailed for 27 years, before being freed in 1990 and
elected president in 1994.</p>
            <p>Since Mr Mandela was hospitalised, his family's battle for
control of his legacy has escalated.</p>
            <p>Last week, his grandson Mandla lost a court case brought by
rival family members over the burial site of three of Mr Mandela's
children.</p>
            <p>Mandla had relocated the bodies to his village of Mvezo without
the rest of the family's consent. However, the court ruled that the
bodies should be reinterred in the family graveyard in Qunu. He may
now face criminal charges for alleged grave tampering.</p>
            <p>After visiting Mr Mandela, King Dalindyebo said he was doing all
he can to give the former leader peace of mind over the affair.</p>
