            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Social gaming
company Zynga has named former Microsoft executive Don Mattrick as
chief executive.</p>
            <p>Mark Pincus, the company's founder and current CEO, said he will
stay on as chairman and chief product officer.</p>
            <p>"Zynga is a great business that has yet to realize its full
potential," said Mr Mattrick in an email to employees.</p>
            <p>At Microsoft, Mr Mattrick was head of interactive entertainment,
the key division that includes Xbox, which is about to launch a new
console.</p>
            <p>Before that, he helped develop popular
games like "The Sims" and "FIFA" for Electronic Arts.</p>
            <p>"I've always saidÃ¢Â€Â¦ that if I
could find someone who could do a better job as our CEO I'd do all
I could to recruit and bring that person in," said Mr Pincus in
<a href="http://blog.zynga.com/2013/07/01/big-day/">a separate
email</a> to staff.</p>
            <p>"I'm confident that Don is that leader."</p>
            <p>Shares in the company, which are down by more than 50% for the
year, shot up once word of the leadership change was first broken
by the website AllThingsD.com.</p>
            <p>At Microsoft, Mr Mattrick helped turn the Xbox business into a
profitable venture after years of losses. His departure comes just
as Microsoft prepares to launch a new version of the console, the
Xbox One.</p>
            <p>Gamers have attacked the high price, Microsoft's plan to require
an internet connection at least once a day and attempts to limit
the sharing of used games.</p>
            <p>Last month, Microsoft reversed its position on the Internet
connection and said it would allow game sharing.</p>
            <p>Zynga has had difficulty almost since its stock market debut in
December 2011, when it was valued at $1bn
(Ã‚Â£656m). News of the appointment sent Zynga
shares more than 10% higher.</p>
            <p>Struggling to replicate the success it found with games like
FarmVille and Words With Friends, it bought OMGPOP, the company
behind the popular game Draw Something, for $200m
(Ã‚Â£131m) in March of 2012. It shut OMGPOP
less than a year later.</p>
            <p>Mobile has also proven challenging for the company, which used
to rely on its close ties with Facebook for users.</p>
            <p>"The gaming market is an especially tough one, particularly as
user behaviour shifts dramatically towards gaming on phones and
tablets," said Clark Fredricksen, of eMarketer. "It's a world of
hit-makers and miss-hits."</p>
            <p>Recently the company has looked to online gambling as another
revenue stream, but that has not yet had an impact on the bottom
line. More than 20% of its staff has been let go in the past year,
and it has shuttered several offices.</p>
            <p>Mr Pincus is the second high profile founder of a social media
company to resign, following Groupon chief executive Andrew Mason's
departure in February.</p>

            <p>Don Mattrick's decision to quit Microsoft follows a bruising E3
tech show last month.</p>
            <p>It was bad enough that the Xbox One was undercut on price by the
PlayStation 4, but the Canadian executive also found himself mocked
for introducing restrictions on second-hand games and insisting
players log onto the net at least once a day.</p>
            <p>His attempt at damage control only made matters worse. Saying
that those wanting an offline mode could still buy the
last-generation Xbox 360 was branded "ridiculous" by one news site
and even led to claims he had "single-handedly alienated the entire
military".</p>
            <p>When Mr Mattrick blogged details of a U-turn one week later,
traffic to the webpage was so great it temporarily became
inaccessible.</p>
            <p>Despite these recent troubles, Mr Mattrick can take credit for
having helped Microsoft outsell Sony in the US and UK for the
current console generation.</p>
            <p>Moving to Zynga offers him a fresh start, but joining a firm
that has recently cancelled games, lost top talent, cut jobs and
seen sales drop off means the pressure on him is unlikely to
ease.</p>
