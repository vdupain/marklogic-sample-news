tackle not only long term but 'here and now' problems</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Brazil has unveiled
plans to hire 10,000 doctors to work in poorly served areas as part
of wider reforms.</p>
            <p>The shake-up will include employing foreign doctors for the
first time from September, as well as changes to the university
medicine curriculum.</p>
            <p>Students graduating from 2015 must serve two years in the public
sector.</p>
            <p>The changes come about a month after millions took to the
streets in mass demonstrations against poor public services,
corruption and other issues.</p>
            <p>The health ministry said the "More Doctors" scheme was modelled
on health services in countries such as Britain and Sweden.</p>
            <p>Foreign doctors will only be considered if the posts are not
filled by Brazilian nationals, officials say.</p>
            <p>The job vacancies will reportedly be advertised at the end of
the month.</p>
            <p>"The More Doctors programme does not have a primary goal of
bringing doctors from abroad, but chiefly of taking more health
services to the inner country," President Dilma Rousseff said.</p>
            <p>Ms Rousseff said the plans were not only tackling a long term
problem but the "here and now" of Brazilians who do not have access
to doctors.</p>
            <p>The doctors hired under the new scheme will be paid a "stipend"
of 10,000 reais (less than $ 4,500 a month).</p>
            <p>President Rousseff also announced investments of more than $3m
in upgrading existing and building new surgeries.</p>
            <p>An extra 11,500 places on medical courses should also be offered
in the next four years, according to government's plans.</p>
            <p>Brazilian medical students are currently required to study six
years before being allowed to practise.</p>
            <p>Under the plans announced on Monday, they will have to work for
two years in the public sector before graduating, upping the
graduation time to eight years.</p>
            <p>Previous projects to attract Cuban doctors to Brazil have met
fierce resistance by doctors' associations.</p>
            <p>The scheme announced on Monday was also met with scepticism by
the Federal Medicine Council, which is considering a court
challenge to the president's decree.</p>
            <p>A series of protests sparked by bus fare rises in June quickly
escalated into nationwide demonstrations against a range of issues,
from corruption to the price of staging the 2014 World Cup.</p>
            <p>Poor public services, including shortcomings in the Brazilian
health system, were a frequent grievance brought up by
protesters.</p>
