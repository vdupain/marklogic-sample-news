            <p class="introduction">Chilean former
President Michelle Bachelet has secured her place in November's
presidential election by winning a key party primary.</p>
            <p>Preliminary results from Sunday's poll show she cannot be caught
by her rivals in the left-wing opposition coalition.</p>
            <p>A primary was also held in the governing conservative Alliance
for Chile. Results so far indicate a close race between two former
ministers.</p>
            <p>Sunday's primary elections were the first ever held in
Chile.</p>
            <p>Ms Bachelet - who served as president between 2006 and 2010 -
won two-thirds of the votes for the New Majority coalition, the
preliminary results suggest.</p>
            <p>She has spent the past three years in New York as head of the
United Nations gender equality agency and is still considered one
of Chile's most popular politicians.</p>
            <p>In the governing centre-right Alliance for Chile, former
ministers Andres Allamand and Pablo Longueira were neck and
neck.</p>
            <p>Voters will choose a successor to President Sebastian Pinera on
17 November. Chilean politicians are prevented from serving
consecutive terms.</p>
            <p>President Pinera became Chile's first right-wing leader in 20
years when he was elected in 2010.</p>
            <p>However, he has seen his popularity drop sharply since then, and
in last month's local elections, his centre-right alliance lost
some key races, including in the capital Santiago.</p>
