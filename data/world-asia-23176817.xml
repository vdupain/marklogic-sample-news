            <p class="introduction">A top female police officer has been shot
dead in Afghanistan's Helmand province, officials say.</p>
            <p>Lt Islam Bibi was ambushed by unknown attackers as she left her
home in the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, a spokesman for
Helmand police said.</p>
            <p>The commander of 32 female police officers, Lt Bibi, 37, was
known as a role model for other women in the conservative
province.</p>
            <p>Her death came as four girls were also killed in a roadside
blast in Helmand.</p>
            <p>Lt Bibi was on a motorbike alongside her son-in-law when she was
wounded in the gun attack. She later died in hospital, officials
say.</p>
            <p>Like most Afghan women in rural areas of Afghanistan, Lt Bibi
had struggled to work outside the home, says the BBC's Bilal
Sarwary in Kabul.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the four girls, said to be aged between seven and 12,
were attending a wedding in Lashkar Gah and had gone to collect
water from a stream when the explosives detonated.</p>
            <p>Last month Afghan forces assumed security responsibility for the
whole country ahead of Nato's departure. Improvised explosive
devices (IEDs) are one of their biggest challenges.</p>
            <p>Helmand is one of Afghanistan's most volatile provinces.</p>
            <p>Correspondents say that civilian casualties in the south have
increased recently, and many of those are due to the use of
improvised explosives by the militants.</p>
