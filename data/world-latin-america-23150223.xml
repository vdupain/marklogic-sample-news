            <p class="introduction">French-Colombian
politician Ingrid Betancourt has marked five years since her
release by Farc militants by appealing for peace in Colombia.</p>
            <p>Ms Betancourt, who was held for more than six years in the
jungle, said she thinks about her ordeal every day.</p>
            <p>"It is not a secret that wars are good business for many," she
told BBC Mundo.</p>
            <p>"This is what we are facing today in Colombia, but we need to
convince each other that the best business for the country is
peace."</p>
            <p>Ms Betancourt was one of 15 hostages freed by Colombian soldiers
on 2 July 2008.</p>
            <p>Soldiers tricked the rebels into handing over the hostages by
masquerading as members of a humanitarian group that had
volunteered to fly them by helicopter to a new location</p>
            <p>She had been a presidential candidate at the time of her
kidnapping in early 2002.</p>
            <p>For years, she was the left-wing rebel group's most high-profile
captive.</p>
            <p>"I think every day about what I went through," she said.</p>
            <p>"There are times when I feel grateful of having had such and
experience, but there are other times when it is a burden.</p>
            <p>"The death of my father, whilst I was in captivity, still hurts
a lot. Also not having been able to see my children grow up."</p>
