operator in China</span>

            <p class="introduction">Yum Brands, owner of
KFC and Pizza Hut restaurant chains, has reported a drop in profits
as a food safety scare continued to hurt its sales in China.</p>
            <p>It made a net profit of $281m (Ã‚Â£185m) in
the three months to 15 June, a 15% drop from a year earlier.</p>
            <p>Sales in China fell 20% during the period amid fears of bird flu
outbreak.</p>
            <p>The fears over the flu came as Yum was trying to recover from
allegations that its suppliers were giving chickens with unapproved
levels of antibiotics.</p>
            <p>Yum said that the "residual effect" of those allegations, first
raised in December, had also impacted sales during the period.</p>
            <p>However, it added that its sales in China were showing signs of
a recovery as the extensive media coverage surrounding Avian flu
had subsided.</p>
            <p>The firm said sales in China declined 10% in June, from a year
earlier, compared with a 19% drop in May. It said that it expects
sales in the country to start rising by the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>China is a key market for Yum, generating more than half the
company's revenue, and the firm said it was committed to expanding
its presence in the country.</p>
            <p>"For the total China Division, we remain on track to open at
least 700 new units this year. This means we will have opened about
1,600 units over a two-year period," David Novak, chief executive
of Yum said in a statement.</p>
            <p>"As KFC sales continue to recover, we expect to have solid
momentum in China heading into 2014," he added.</p>
            <p>The company confirmed that is expects a sharp drop in profits
this year, but added that it expected a "big bounce-back" in
2014.</p>
