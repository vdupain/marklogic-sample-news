abandon my country"</p>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Portugal's Prime
Minister Pedro Passos Coelho has said he will not stand down,
despite the resignation of two key members of his government in as
many days.</p>
            <p>He said he would not abandon his country, hours after Foreign
Minister Paulo Portas announced his resignation.</p>
            <p>On Monday, Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar stepped down, pointing
to public opposition to austerity measures.</p>
            <p>Portugal's borrowing costs rose and stock market fell 6% on
Wednesday.</p>
            <p>Portugal is struggling to meet the terms of the 78bn-euro
bailout it negotiated in 2011, and the markets apparently fear that
political uncertainty could throw efforts to consolidate its
finances off course.</p>
            <p>"I won't give up on my country," the Social Democrat PM said in
a televised address on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>He also said he had not accepted the resignation of Mr Portas,
whose CDS-PP party is a junior member of the centre-right
coalition.</p>
            <p>Political commentators immediately
responded with scepticism to the idea that the foreign minister
could stay on in government, BBC Lisbon correspondent Alison
Roberts reports.</p>
            <p>Mr Portas was given the task of overseeing budget cuts when the
finance minister resigned on Monday.</p>
            <p>"The prime minister chose to follow the path of continuity at
the finance ministry," Mr Portas said in his letter of resignation
on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>"I respect this choice but I disagree. I expressed this view to
the prime minister who nevertheless confirmed his choice."</p>
            <p>The coalition has found it difficult to meet the terms of the
bailout agreed in 2011 by the former Socialist government, with
austerity measures blamed for causing Portugal's worst economic
crisis since the 1970s.</p>
            <p>Portugal has been in recession for two years and the economy is
expected to contract by 2.3% this year.</p>
            <p>Unemployment stands at over 17.5%, with thousands of
higher-educated people seeking work abroad.</p>
            <p>The government has also become increasingly isolated with the
country's two main trade union federations joining forces to
organise a general strike last week, which brought public transport
to a halt.</p>
            <p>Business confederations have called on the coalition to ease
austerity measures.</p>
            <p>The coalition came to power two years ago in early elections
following the collapse of the Socialist government, which requested
the bailout from the IMF and EU after admitting their own policies
had failed.</p>
            <p>Mr Gaspar, the man seen as the architect of austerity in
Portugal, said in his resignation letter that he was leaving
because of the growing erosion of public support for austerity
measures.</p>
