            <p class="introduction">Nearly 3,000 people
are still missing following floods and landslides which hit India's
Uttarakhand state a fortnight ago, the chief minister of the state
has said.</p>
            <p>More than 800 people are reported to have been killed so far but
Vijay Bahuguna said the exact number of deaths may never be
known.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of people are still trapped in the Badrinath area,
reports say.</p>
            <p>Some 100,000 people have already been evacuated from the
flood-hit region.</p>
            <p>This year's early monsoon rains in the Uttarakhand region are
believed to be the heaviest in 80 years.</p>
            <p>Swollen rivers have swept away entire villages in the state,
where there were many travellers in what is peak tourist
season.</p>

            <p>"We will never know the exact number of the dead and the number
of people buried or washed away," Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna
told the Press Trust of India news agency.</p>
            <p>"According to my information about 3,000 people are still
missing. We will compensate their families. They have to give an
affidavit saying that their relatives have not returned home for
more than 30 days."</p>
            <p>Officials say many bodies may have been washed away or remain
buried under debris. Some of the bodies were recovered in rivers
downstream from the flood zone.</p>
            <p>Distraught relatives clutching photographs of missing family
members have been waiting for days in the state capital, Dehradun,
hoping for news.</p>
            <p>The Indian military has been flying helicopters into the
mountains to evacuate tens of thousands of people trapped by
damaged roads and landslides.</p>
            <p>Reports say some 900 Hindu pilgrims and tourists are still
stranded in the Badrinath, one of the worst-affected areas. They
are expected to be evacuated on Monday.</p>
            <p>While most of the stranded people have been rescued, the extent
of the damage to the local communities is still unclear.</p>
