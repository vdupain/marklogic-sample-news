               <span style="width:304px;">The gang rape of the 23-year-old woman
shocked India</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">An Indian juvenile
court has deferred its verdict in the case of an 18-year-old
accused of taking part in the fatal gang rape of a woman on a Delhi
bus.</p>
            <p>He is charged with rape, murder, destroying evidence, and other
crimes including kidnapping carried out while aged 17. He faces up
to three years in a reform facility if convicted.</p>
            <p>The verdict is now expected on 25 July.</p>
            <p>He has denied the charges - as have four adults on trial at a
specially convened fast-track court.</p>
            <p>They face the death penalty.</p>
            <p>A sixth suspect was found dead in jail. Prison officials have
said they believe he hanged himself but defence lawyers and his
family allege he was murdered.</p>
            <p>The attack sparked mass protests throughout India and a national
debate about the treatment of women.</p>
            <p>If found guilty, the 18-year-old can be
sent to a reform facility for up to three years. This would include
the time he has spent while waiting for the verdict.</p>
            <p>"The idea behind the provision is that three years is sufficient
time to reform a child", Anant Kumar Asthana, a Delhi-based lawyer
told the AFP news agency.</p>
            <p>However, many, including the family of the victim, had demanded
that the teenager - who was six months short of becoming an adult
at the time of the crime - should be treated as an adult and face
the death penalty for his alleged crime.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the ruling Congress party, Renuka Chowhary,
said in January that "given the nature of the crime, the most
gruesome and heinous way a crime is committed, it has to be
revisited to see how we define the word juvenile".</p>
            <p>Under Indian laws the juvenile accused can not be named for
legal reasons.</p>
            <p>Having left his village at the age of 11, he lived his formative
years alone, doing menial jobs in Delhi.</p>
            <p>In March, India passed a new bill containing harsher
punishments, including the death penalty, for rapists.</p>
            <p>The victim, a physiotherapy student who cannot be named in India
for legal reasons, and a male friend were attacked on a bus on 16
December.</p>
            <p>Police said the assailants beat both of them, and then raped the
woman. She suffered massive internal injuries and died nearly two
weeks later.</p>
