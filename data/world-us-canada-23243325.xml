            <p class="introduction">Three women
allegedly held captive for about a decade by a man in Cleveland,
Ohio, have broken their silence to thank the public for its
support.</p>
            <p>In a YouTube video, Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle
Knight said they were trying to rebuild their lives.</p>
            <p>One of the women said she had been to hell and back, but did not
want to be bitter.</p>
            <p>Former school bus driver Ariel Castro faces 329 counts of rape,
kidnapping and other charges.</p>
            <p>The three-minute video was posted on YouTube at midnight on
Monday by a public relations firm.</p>
            <p>The three women each spoke briefly to
thank members of the public for their donations to a fund to help
them.</p>
            <p>Ms Berry, 27, who prosecutors say gave birth to a daughter by Mr
Castro during her time in captivity, smiled as she said in the
video: "I am getting stronger each day, and having my privacy has
helped immensely.</p>
            <p>"I ask that everyone continues to respect our privacy and give
us time to have a normal life."</p>
            <p>Ms Knight, 32, also smiled as she said she was building a "brand
new life".</p>
            <p>"I may have been through hell and back," she read from a
prepared statement, "but I am strong enough to walk through hell
with a smile on my face and my head held high.</p>
            <p>"I will not let the situation define who I am. I will define the
situation. I don't want to be consumed by hatred."</p>
            <p>Mr Castro is accused of making Ms Knight pregnant, then starving
and punching her to cause her to miscarry.</p>
            <p>The third woman, Ms DeJesus, 23, spoke simply to thank people
for their support. She was accompanied by her parents, who did the
same.</p>
            <p>The women were freed in May from Mr Castro's home, where they
were allegedly held following their separate abductions aged 14, 16
and 20 between 2002-04.</p>
