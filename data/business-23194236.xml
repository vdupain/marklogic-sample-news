            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Brazilian
billionaire Eike Batista has begun a major reorganisation of his
business empire.</p>
            <p>The company is heavily in debt and the money raised will be used
to pay off creditors, including Brazilian banks Itau and
Bradesco.</p>
            <p>Once complete, Mr Batista will be left with $1.7bn
(Ã‚Â£1.1bn) of debt. His empire was once
valued at $60bn.</p>
            <p>Most shares in Batista's EBX Group, comprising of oil, mining
and energy companies, are now almost worthless.</p>
            <p>Brazil's economy is struggling as its currency weakens and the
driving force behind its growth in the last decade - demand from
China - is slowing down.</p>
            <p>Mr Batista has stepped down as chairman
of electricity generation MPX Energia SA, which is EBX Group's most
promising business. That firm will rebrand by October to position
itself outside the EBX Group.</p>
            <p>German utility company E.On SE has agreed to buy up to 367m
reais ($163m; Ã‚Â£108m) worth of stock in MPX.
It currently owns 36% of the company, and it could see its share
increase to 38%.</p>
            <p>"MPX is the best company in the group, and they are working
quickly to insulate the company and separate it from the risk
associated with Batista's EBX Group," said Ricardo Correa, analyst
at energy company Ativa Corretora.</p>
            <p>Reports say that to avoid bankruptcy, Batista will have to sell
most of his remaining stakes in EBX companies, with the Port of
Acu, north of Rio de Janeiro, the only major asset likely to
remain.</p>
            <p>"Batista's plight is like Brazil's, a sign we can no longer
ignore the country's plight," said Alexandre Barros from political
risk consultancy Early Warning.</p>
