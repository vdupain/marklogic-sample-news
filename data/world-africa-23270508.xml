            <p class="introduction">At least seven
people have been killed after a residential building collapsed in a
poor neighbourhood in Nigeria's main city, Lagos, officials have
said.</p>
            <p>A baby was among at least seven other people rescued from the
three-story building in the Ebute-Meta neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>The building caved in because of structural defects, officials
added.</p>
            <p>Lagos is one of the most overcrowded cities in Africa, with many
badly built structures and poor safety standards.</p>
            <p>Nigerian Red Cross official Oladimeji Ige said rescue operations
were continuing as they suspected that more people were trapped
under the building, AP news agency reports.</p>
            <p>He confirmed that an infant was among victims when the building
caved in before dawn on Thursday.</p>
