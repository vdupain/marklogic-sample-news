            <p class="introduction">Pilots of the plane
that crashed at San Francisco airport on Saturday tried to abort
the landing seconds before touching down, US investigators say.</p>
            <p>Initial inquiries suggested the Asiana plane was flying
"significantly below" its target speed on approach.</p>
            <p>And the Korean airline revealed that the pilot was landing a
Boeing 777 at San Francisco for the first time.</p>
            <p>Two Chinese teenagers died and more than 180 people were injured
when the plane hit the seawall.</p>
            <p>Sixty of the passengers on board the flight from Seoul,
including the two girls who died, were Chinese schoolchildren on
their way to summer camp.</p>

               <span style="width:226px;">Ye Mengyuan (left) and Wang Linjia were
described as close friends</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chinese state media named the two as Ye Mengyuan and Wang
Linjia, both 16, who were classmates at a school in eastern
Zhejiang Province.</p>
            <p>Both girls were pronounced dead at the airport. A coroner is
trying to determine if one of the victims was run over and killed
by an emergency vehicle.</p>
            <p>Two fire chiefs raised that possibility at a news conference on
Monday.</p>
            <p>Their families, as well as relatives of the injured, are
travelling to San Francisco.</p>
            <p>More than 30 people remained in hospital late on Sunday.</p>
            <p>Medical officials said eight were listed in critical condition,
including two with paralysis from spinal injuries.</p>
            <p>Asiana said 141 of the 291 passengers were Chinese, 77 were
Korean and 61 were Americans.</p>
            <p>At a news conference on Sunday, National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) chief Deborah Hersman said the aircraft's speed was
below the planned 137 knots (158mph; 254km/h) as it approached the
runway.</p>
            <p>"We are not talking about a few knots here or there. We're
talking about a significant amount of speed below 137," she
said.</p>

            <p>She said the pilots had tried to speed
up, before trying to abort the landing less than two seconds before
touching down.</p>
            <p>Ms Hersman stressed that it was too early
to speculate on precise causes for the accident.</p>
            <p>The airline said mechanical failure did not appear to have been
a factor.</p>
            <p>Late on Sunday, Asiana released more details about the pilot,
Lee Kang-kuk.</p>
            <p>They said he had only 43 flying hours in a Boeing 777, and was
assisted by another more experienced pilot as he landed the
aircraft.</p>
            <p>The airline insisted such in-flight supervision was standard
practice within the aviation industry.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, US officials confirmed that a navigation system
helping pilots make safe descents had been turned off for
maintenance since June.</p>
            <p>The Glide Path is used for landings in bad weather conditions,
but it was clear and sunny when the Asiana Airlines aircraft
crashed.</p>
            <p>The Boeing 777 has a good safety record, and this is thought to
be the first fatal crash.</p>
            <p>The only previous notable crash occurred when a British Airways
plane landed short of the runway at London's Heathrow Airport in
2008.</p>
            <p>Footage of the scene in San Francisco on
Saturday showed debris strewn on the runway and smoke pouring from
the jet, as fire crews sprayed a white fire retardant into gaping
holes in the aircraft's roof.</p>
            <p>One engine and the tail fin were broken away from the main
wreckage.</p>
            <p>Cabin manager Lee Yoon-hye told reporters that during the
evacuation, two slides had inflated toward the inside of the plane,
instead of outside, hurting two flight attendants.</p>
            <p>Passenger Ben Levy said the accident "happened in a flash" and
there was "chaos, disbelief, screaming".</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, people "calmed down pretty quickly", he added, and
evacuated the plane without a stampede.</p>
            <p>Another passenger, David Eun, <a href="https://twitter.com/Eunner/status/353592664526028801">tweeted a
picture</a> of people going down the plane's emergency inflatable
slides and wrote: "I just crash landed at SFO. Tail ripped off.
Most everyone seems fine. I'm ok. Surreal."</p>
            <p>A Chinese passenger, Fei Xiong, wearing a neck brace after being
injured during the crash landing, told a San Francisco news
conference her eight-year-old had noticed something was wrong
during the plane's descent.</p>
            <p>"My son told me, 'the plane will fall down, it's too close to
the sea,'" she said. "I told him, 'no, baby, it's OK, we'll be
fine.' And then the plane just fell down."</p>
