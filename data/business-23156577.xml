               <span style="width:304px;">Yahoo has been trying to turn around its fortunes
and win back users from rivals</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Yahoo has acquired
Qwiki, the start-up behind an iPhone app that allows users to turn
photos, music and videos into short movies automatically.</p>
            <p>Yahoo has been on a shopping spree as it looks to win
advertisers and users back from rivals Google and Facebook.</p>
            <p>It recent days it has acquired blogging service Tumblr and
Bignoggins Productions which specialises in fantasy sports apps for
iPhones.</p>
            <p>Yahoo did not disclose the amount it paid to buy Qwiki.</p>
            <p>However, technology blog AllThingsD reported that the deal was
valued between $40m - $50m
(Ã‚Â£26m-Ã‚Â£33m).</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/54451173706/qwiki-qwiki-yahoo">Yahoo
said in a statement</a> that it "will continue to support the Qwiki
app, and the team will join Yahoo! in our New York city office to
reimagine Yahoo!'s storytelling experience".</p>
            <p>Yahoo was one of the earliest entrants in the internet market
and enjoyed tremendous success as the sector boomed.</p>
            <p>However, it has struggled in recent years in the face of
increased competition from search rivals including Google and the
emergence of social media giants such as Facebook.</p>
            <p>In attempt to turn around its fortunes it appointed former
leading Google executive Marissa Mayer as its chief executive last
year.</p>
            <p>Ms Meyer took the helm in July 2012 and has been snapping up
firms as part of her plan to revive Yahoo.</p>
            <p>Since her arrival Yahoo has bought various firms including start
ups such as Alike, Stamped, Snip.it and a Summly application built
by a teenager in the UK.</p>
            <p>In May, it redesigned its photo-sharing service, Flickr,
offering users up to 1TB of storage without a fee.</p>
            <p>It said the revamp would also allow users to host longer video
clips and higher-resolution photos.</p>
