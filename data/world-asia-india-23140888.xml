               <span style="width:464px;">Suraj Pancholi was held on charges of
abetting his actor girlfriend's suicide</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Last year, <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/farm-suicide-trends-in-2012-remain-dismal/article4860980.ece">
more than 13,000 farmers</a> killed themselves in India.</p>
            <p>Most were saddled with steep debts, having failed to pay back
loans they had taken from banks, micro-finance companies and money
lenders after their crops failed. Farm suicides - nearly 300,000
since 1995 - are India's shame, a colossal national tragedy.</p>
            <p>But, can the lenders be lawfully charged with abetting such
suicides?</p>
            <p>Going by India's laws, yes. The country's <a href="http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/IPC1860.pdf">153-year-old penal laws</a>
say <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/92983/">abetting
suicide</a> can fetch the offender up to 10 years in prison and a
fine.</p>
            <p>In May, Sudipta Sen, a businessman who allegedly defrauded
thousands of depositors in the eastern state of West Bengal,
<a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-05-23/india/39474487_1_saradha-group-sudipta-sen-debjani">
was charged</a> with abetting the suicide of a "depressed"
investor.</p>
            <div class="caption body-narrow-width">
               <img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/68508000/jpg/_68508325_68508324.jpg"

                 alt="File photograph of Jiah Khan"/>
               <span style="width:304px;">Jiah Khan's mother accused Mr Pancholi
of abusing her daughter</span>
            </div>
            <p>So was Suraj Pancholi, who was arrested after his girlfriend,
Bollywood actress Jiah Khan, killed herself last month.</p>
            <p>Mr Pancholi spent time in prison after police announced they
intended to charge him with abetment. He was <a href="/news/world-asia-india-23124234"
               title="Dead Indian star's boyfriend bailed">bailed on Monday</a>, with
the judge saying he did not appear to have a motive for inciting
his girlfriend to kill herself.</p>
            <p>Tuesday's papers reported a <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/film-editor-ends-life-exboyfriend-arrested/article4871344.ece">
similar incident</a>. The former boyfriend of a film editor, who
allegedly took her life, has been detained and charged with
abetment of suicide in Mumbai. Reports said she had accused her
boyfriend of rape and, more recently, he had called off their
planned wedding.</p>
            <p>India's Supreme Court has repeatedly said that to convict a
person for abetting suicide, it has to be proved that they
instigated the suicide or that "there was a <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2011/03/03/stories/2011030362420400.htm">clear
intention</a> to commit the offence".</p>
            <p>"It's not easy to prove," leading lawyer KTS Tulsi tells me.
"It's like showing the gun, showing the poison [to the victim] and
telling him or her, 'go ahead and die'. That's the kind of active
facilitation which is not easy to prove."</p>
            <p>No wonder the conviction rate in cases of abetment to suicide is
abysmally low - 1-2%, Mr Tulsi says. More than 135,000 people took
their lives in India in 2012 - more men than women, and the
majority of them married.</p>
            <p>Mr Tulsi accuses the police of abusing the law. "The law is very
clear about how abetment should be defined. Unfortunately, our
police are not literate enough in grasping the finer definitions of
laws. The result is unnecessary harassment of people," he says.</p>
            <p>Legal experts believe India still needs the law, considering the
large number of women who still take their lives following dowry
demands. More than 8,000 <a href="http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/653797/">dowry deaths</a> were
reported in India last year, according to the <a href="http://ncrb.gov.in/index.htm">National Crime Records Bureau</a>. A
third of the offenders were convicted. Lawyers believe many of
these convictions related to the suicide of a dowry victim were
secured after proving the abetment charge.</p>
            <p>However, India possibly needs to scrap the other colonial-era
law that <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1501595/">makes it
illegal to take your life</a>. It is a crime that can fetch you a
year of prison time. <a href="/news/magazine-14374296" title="When suicide was illegal">England scrapped a similar law in
1961</a>, but the former colony still persists with what many
believe is a retrograde measure.</p>
