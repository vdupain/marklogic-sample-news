a foreign brand</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Dalian Wanda Group,
a Chinese property developer, has said that it will spend
Ã‚Â£1bn ($1.6bn) to buy a British yacht maker
and property in London.</p>
            <p>Wanda will pay Ã‚Â£320m for almost 92% of
Sunseeker International, famous for providing yachts for James Bond
movies.</p>
            <p>It will also invest Ã‚Â£700m to develop a
five-star hotel in London.</p>
            <p>The luxury hotel in London will be the first such development to
be operated by a Chinese firm overseas. The move was welcomed by
the Mayor of London.</p>
            <p>Boris Johnson said that the deal was "yet another sign of the
soaring global confidence in London as a world-beating place to
live, work and do business".</p>

            <p>Wang Jianlian, chief executive and founder of Wanda added that
"the London property market has excellent investment opportunities
and we have confidence that Wanda's strength and expertise will
help make The Wanda London's premier hotel, and will further
promote development in the area".</p>
            <p>The new hotel will be built by the river in Vauxhall, South
London as part of the Nine Elms regeneration.</p>
            <p>Wanda, which was founded in 1998 and already operates 34
five-star hotels in China, said that it plans to build a chain of
Wanda hotels across other foreign cities as well.</p>
            <p>"Through the international development of Wanda Hotels, we are
confident that we will be the leader in bringing branded Chinese
luxury hotels to the global market, where they have long been
absent," said Mr Wang, who is one of China's richest men</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Dalian Wanda Group plan to develop a
luxury hotel in London.</span>
            </div>
            <p>China's rapid economic growth has been accompanied by a surge in
the number of high net worth individuals, which has driven up
demand for luxury goods.</p>
            <p>In an attempt to cater to growing demand and tap into the
lucrative market, Chinese firms have been keen to buy established
foreign brands.</p>
            <p>"Sunseeker's powerful motor yachts have featured in four James
Bond films and countless paparazzi photos so it's no coincidence
that the brand is now being sold to a country with no shortage of
multi-millionaires," said the BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai.</p>
            <p>"It's another sign of China's growing UK imprint. Chinese
businessmen now have interests in brands as diverse as Birmingham
City Football Club, MG Cars, Thames Water and Weetabix."</p>
            <p>Mr Wang said: "China's consumption is growing, especially the
market for high-end luxury products, it is growing very
rapidly."</p>
            <p>"We have noticed the growth in consumption of luxury yachts,
also private planes," he said, adding that the growth in the luxury
segment was "exponential".</p>
