            <p class="introduction">Three former
executives of Olympus have been given suspended jail terms for
their roles in an accounting scandal.</p>
            <p>Former chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa and executives Hisashi Mori
and Hideo Yamada pleaded guilty last year to charges of falsifying
accounts to cover up losses of $1.7bn
(Ã‚Â£1.1bn).</p>
            <p>Mr Kikukawa and Mr Yamada were given three-year sentences and Mr
Mori a two-and-a-half-year sentence.</p>
            <p>Olympus was ordered to pay 700m yen ($7m;
Ã‚Â£4.6m) in fines for its role.</p>
            <p>The scandal is one of the biggest financial frauds in Japan's
history.</p>
            <p>It came to light in 2011 after then chief executive Michael
Woodford was dismissed from his post after challenging Mr Kikukawa
and the board over suspiciously large payments related to
acquisitions.</p>
            <p>That led to an investigation being launched, which revealed a
cover-up of losses dating back to the 1990s.</p>
            <p>Mr Kikukawa, former executive vice-president Mr Mori and former
auditing officer Mr Yamada were arrested in February last year and
later indicted on suspected violation of the Financial Instruments
and Exchange Act.</p>
            <p>All three had admitted to hiding losses in September last
year.</p>
            <p>The scandal also hit Olympus shareholders, as the firm lost
almost 80% of its value in the aftermath of the revelations.</p>
            <p>However, there have been signs that the firm may be recovering
from the scandal.</p>
            <p>It has announced a major overhaul and entered into an alliance
with electronics giant Sony to try to boost its share of the global
medical equipment market.</p>
            <p>The company has returned to profit and its shares have also
recovered most of their losses.</p>
