            <p class="introduction">Shares of Japanese
camera and medical equipment maker Olympus have fallen after it
unveiled plans to raise 118bn yen ($1.2bn;
Ã‚Â£780m) in fresh capital.</p>
            <p>Olympus will raise the funds by selling new shares to overseas
investors to fund the expansion of its medical equipment
businesses.</p>
            <p>Some funds will also be used to repay debt and rebuild its
financial health after a recent accounting scandal.</p>
            <p>Its shares dipped 5.4% to a near eight-week low of 2,928 yen in
Tokyo.</p>
            <p>"The company intends to use the net proceeds to further its
growth strategies... which focus on the further strengthening of
its medical business and rebuilding its financial health," Olympus
said in a statement.</p>
            <p>The company is one of the biggest players in the global medical
equipment market.</p>
            <p>However, its reputation took a big blow after the revelations of
an accounting scandal at the firm in 2011.</p>
            <p>The scandal, one the biggest financial frauds in Japan's
history, came to light after then chief executive Michael Woodford
was dismissed from his post after challenging chairman Tsuyoshi
Kikukawa and the board over suspiciously large payments related to
acquisitions.</p>
            <p>That led to an investigation being launched, which revealed a
cover-up of losses dating back to the 1990s.</p>
            <p>Mr Kikukawa and executives Hisashi Mori and Hideo Yamada
subsequently resigned and pleaded guilty to charges of falsifying
accounts to cover up losses of $1.7bn
(Ã‚Â£1.1bn).</p>
            <p>Last week, a Japanese court gave the three executives suspended
jail terms for their roles in the accounting scandal.</p>
            <p>Olympus was ordered to pay 700m yen in fines.</p>
