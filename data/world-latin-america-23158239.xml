            <p class="introduction">Mexican police have
found the charred corpse of a man suspected of kidnapping 12 young
people from a Mexico City bar.</p>
            <p>Dax Rodriguez Ledezma's body was found along with that of his
girlfriend.</p>
            <p>The 12 were reported missing on 26 May after they failed to
return home from the Heaven bar, which was co-owned by Rodriguez
Ledezma.</p>
            <p>The apparent abductions took place in daylight in the capital's
bustling Zona Rosa district. The 12 youngsters have not been seen
since.</p>
            <p>Investigators have said they believe the case is related to
drug-gang rivalry in Mexico City's Tepito district, one of its
poorest areas.</p>
            <p>Most of the abducted youngsters came from Tepito, and three of
them are related to jailed crime bosses from the area.</p>
            <p>Surveillance footage showed a number of them being led from the
bar by men in civilian clothes and getting into cars.</p>
            <p>At least 17 people and eight vehicles were involved in the
abduction.</p>
            <p>Several people have been arrested in the case, including
Rodriguez Ledezma's brother, who co-owned the bar.</p>
            <p>Officials said the body was identified through DNA compared with
that of his brother, who has been charged over the kidnappings.</p>
            <p>The authorities said the burned corpses had been found in the
town of Huitzilac in Morelos state.</p>
            <p>They released no further details, but the AP news agency
reported that 10 days ago Morales police announced they had found
the burned bodies of two women and a man, their heads covered in
duct tape, on a dirt road in Huitzilac.</p>
            <p>An estimated 70,000 people have died in drug-related violence in
Mexico over the past six years, much of it committed by powerful
drug cartels.</p>
            <p>The violence has mainly been concentrated in the northern states
bordering the United States and in the west, with the capital
largely spared.</p>
