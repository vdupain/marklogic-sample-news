against him are politically motivated</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Italy's highest
court has set 30 July as the date for hearing ex-PM Silvio
Berlusconi's tax fraud appeal - a much earlier date than
expected.</p>
            <p>His lawyers said the decision was a "squeeze on the rights of
the defence".</p>
            <p>The early hearing could prevent the statute of limitations from
expiring on one of the charges, analysts say.</p>
            <p>In May an appeals court upheld Mr Berlusconi's conviction. It
also reinstated a four-year jail term and five-year ban from public
office.</p>
            <p>The 76-year-old was convicted of artificially inflating prices
of film distribution rights bought by his company, Mediaset, to
avoid taxes.</p>
            <p>Mr Berlusconi denies the charges and says
they are politically motivated.</p>
            <p>The Court of Cassation set the new hearing date on the day the
appeal was formally lodged.</p>
            <p>Italy's justice system is notoriously slow in dealing with
appeals, and Tuesday's decision by the court drew an angry reaction
from Mr Berlusconi's defence team.</p>
            <p>"I have never seen a hearing programmed as quickly as this. I am
astonished," lawyer Franco Coppi told the Reuters news agency.</p>
            <p>"This is a real squeeze on the rights of the defence."</p>
            <p>If the court upholds Mr Berlusconi's conviction, he will have no
further right to appeal.</p>
            <p>Analysts say that the former premier may still avoid prison due
to his age, but the ban on holding public office would deprive him
of his seat in parliament.</p>
            <p>It could also put pressure on current Prime Minister Enrico
Letta's coalition cabinet, which depends for support on Mr
Berlusconi's centre-right People of Freedom Party.</p>
            <p>The tax fraud trial is only one of a series of legal battles Mr
Berlusconi has faced in recent years.</p>
            <p>Last month, he was sentenced to seven years in jail and banned
from public office for having sex with an underage prostitute, and
abuse of power.</p>
