proceedings of parliament was interrupted by their
walkout</span>

            <p class="introduction">The Pakistani government has criticised a
decision by the BBC Urdu service to terminate the jobs of nine
senior reporters across the country.</p>
            <p>Information minister Pervez Rasheed said that the matter would
be raised with the "concerned authorities".</p>
            <p>His statement in parliament came after journalists covering its
proceedings walked out of the press gallery in protest at the BBC's
decision.</p>
            <p>A BBC spokesman said it was necessary for the Urdu service to
make savings.</p>
            <p>"In common with other parts of the BBC, the Urdu service has
been tasked with making savings as part of the Comprehensive
Spending Review (CSR)," the spokesman said,</p>
            <p>"Out of a total staff of 69 people in Pakistan, we have
announced 10 job cuts - one management post and nine editorial
posts.</p>
            <p>"We communicated the job losses to staff in March 2013 and have
followed a fair selection process in accordance with BBC policies
and Pakistani labour law guidelines."</p>
            <p>The spokesman said that the BBC was continuing to devote
"considerable resources to reporting" in Pakistan and has a staff
of nearly 60 people including 30 journalists working across the
country - five years ago there were fewer than 20 staff.</p>
            <p>Nine BBC Urdu service reporters were told they were to lose
their jobs in April. Their contracts ceased on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>Mr Rasheed was briefed on the issue by Aijaz Mahar, one of the
BBC reporters affected.</p>
            <p>"The entire journalist community in Pakistan is in sorrow, grief
and anger over the action of the BBC management," the minister said
in parliament.</p>
            <p>He added that the sudden termination was "not tolerable under
the Pakistani laws, but also under the laws of the country where
the BBC is headquartered".</p>
            <p>"I will make efforts to resolve this issue by contacting the
concerned organisation [the BBC], and also the Pakistani
departments that regulate [the electronic media] in the country,"
he said.</p>
            <p>The affected reporters argue that they have not been offered
redundancies in line with the BBC's redundancy policy and have been
ignored when applying for alternative jobs.</p>
