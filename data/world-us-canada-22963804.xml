            <p class="introduction">The
Republican-controlled US House of Representatives has passed a bill
that would introduce strict abortion limits.</p>
            <p>The plan to restrict terminations to the first 20 weeks after
conception was approved by 228 votes to 196, largely along party
lines.</p>
            <p>But it has no chance of becoming law as Democrats control the
Senate and the White House has threatened a veto.</p>
            <p>Most US states allow abortions to when a foetus becomes viable
outside the womb, considered to be some 24 weeks.</p>
            <p>The Republican leadership pressed ahead with the abortion bill
after the case of Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortion doctor
who was recently sentenced to life in prison after being convicted
of killing three babies delivered alive.</p>
            <p>The legislation passed on Tuesday makes exceptions for victims
of rape and incest, as long as they first report the crime to
authorities.</p>
            <p>Republican congressman Trent Franks, the bill's sponsor,
provoked outrage last week when he said in a committee hearing that
the "incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy [is] very low".</p>
            <p>BBC Washington correspondent Jane Little says that while the
bill has delighted the Republicans' core social-conservative
supporters, it may alienate the female, young, and independent
voters that party bosses hope to win over.</p>
            <p>Controversial remarks about abortion by Republicans provoked a
backlash during the November 2012 elections.</p>
            <p>One candidate said women's bodies could prevent pregnancy in
cases of "legitimate rape"; another said pregnancy resulting from
rape was "something God intended to happen".</p>
            <p>Ten US states have passed laws similar to the House bill,
although several are facing legal challenges.</p>
