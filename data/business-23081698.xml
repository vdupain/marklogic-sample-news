lift Wall Street</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">US consumer spending
rebounded in May, rising by 0.3% and reversing a 0.3% fall in
April, official figures show.</p>
            <p>Other data published on Thursday also suggested that the US
economy remains on a growth path.</p>
            <p>The number of new claimants for unemployment benefits fell last
week, while contracts to buy previously-owned homes were at a
six-year high in May.</p>
            <p>The data helped lift Wall Street, with the Dow Jones up 1% and
S&amp;P and Nasdaq indexes up about 0.8%.</p>
            <p>Analysts said the figures were not spectacular, but at least
showed that the economy was heading in the right direction.</p>
            <p>The Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment
benefits last week fell 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 346,000. The
four-week moving average for new claims, which irons out
week-to-week volatility, fell 2,750 to 345,750.</p>
            <p>"Economic growth is not over the top, that's for sure," said
Chris Rupkey chief financial economist at the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi. But he added: "We expect, however, economic
growth will be strong enough to bring unemployment down at an
acceptable pace."</p>
