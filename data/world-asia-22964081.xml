North Korea should draw lessons from the Third Reich</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">North Korea has
condemned a report that its leader, Kim Jong-un, gave out copies of
Adolf Hitler's memoir Mein Kampf to officials on his birthday.</p>
            <p>The report, from a news website run by North Korean defectors,
said that senior officials were given the book as a gift in
January.</p>
            <p>North Korea has denounced the defectors as "human scum" and
threatened to kill them.</p>
            <p>Nazi leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/people/adolf_hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>
wrote Mein Kampf in 1924 while in prison.</p>
            <p>The book, which translates in English as My Struggle, outlines
his early life and racist views.</p>
            <p>News portal <a href="http://newfocusintl.com/north-korea-hitler-third-reich/">New Focus
International</a> wrote the original report, citing an unnamed
North Korean official in China.</p>
            <p>"Mentioning that Hitler managed to rebuild Germany in a short
time following its defeat in WWI, Kim Jong-un issued an order for
the Third Reich to be studied in depth and asked that practical
applications be drawn from it," the source reportedly said.</p>
            <p>North Korea's Ministry of People's Security, which is
responsible for policing, issued an angry response which was
carried by the country's official news agency, KCNA.</p>
            <p>It dismissed the report as a "smear campaign" written by "a
handful of human scum... moving desperately to deter [North
Korea's] progress".</p>
            <p>The defectors were being used by South Korea and the US, it went
on.</p>
            <p>The ministry was determined to "physically remove [the]
despicable human scum who are committing treason", the statement
added.</p>
            <p>The two Koreas remain technically at war after the 1950-53
Korean war ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.</p>
            <p>Ties between the two are currently very tense in the wake of
Pyongyang's 12 February nuclear test.</p>
            <p>It is estimated that more than 20,000 North Koreans have
defected to the South since the 1950s.</p>
            <p>However, fleeing North Korea is dangerous, and defectors who are
repatriated to North Korea face punishments including labour camps
and execution, activists say.</p>
