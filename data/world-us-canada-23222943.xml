            <p class="introduction">The wife of US
Secretary of State John Kerry has been taken to hospital in Boston
where she is reported to be in a critical condition.</p>
            <p>Teresa Heinz Kerry, 74, became ill during a family holiday in
Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Sunday.</p>
            <p>Her condition was stabilised at the local hospital before she
was transferred to a hospital in Boston, Mr Kerry's spokesman
said.</p>
            <p>Mr Kerry is reported to have travelled with his wife to
Boston.</p>
            <p>"The family is grateful for the outpouring of support it has
received and aware of the interest in her condition, but they ask
for privacy at this time," Mr Kerry's spokesman Glen Johnson
said.</p>
            <p>Born to a Portuguese family in Mozambique, Teresa Heinz Kerry is
a former UN interpreter and widow of Senator John Heinz, heir to
the ketchup company fortune, who died in 1991.</p>
            <p>She married Mr Kerry in 1995. It was a second marriage for both
of them.</p>
            <p>Ms Heinz Kerry revealed in 2009 that she had been treated for
breast cancer.</p>
