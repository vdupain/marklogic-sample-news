               <span style="width:464px;">Competition to get in to school places
in Hong Kong has become fierce</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">In early June,
thousands of parents queued for hours outside a school in Sheung
Shui district near the border between Hong Kong and mainland
China.</p>
            <p>The massed parents were waiting to find out whether their
children had got into their primary school of choice.</p>
            <p>Competition for school places has become fierce as more mainland
Chinese children compete with local residents for places - and
families on both sides of the border are finding it stressful.</p>
            <p>One Hong Kong mother whose child did not get into her school of
choice emerged with her hands covering her face to hide tears.</p>
            <p>As local media surrounded her, she crouched down and sobbed
uncontrollably.</p>
            <p>These images have been playing out in the local press, amid
rising grievances among Hong Kong residents over issues linked to
the mainland.</p>
            <p>The territory is governed under the principle of "one country,
two systems", under which Hong Kong retains a high degree of
autonomy for 50 years from the British handover. Its social
services, amongst other things, are seen as more advanced than on
the mainland.</p>
            <p>Families along the border have fought in recent years over
hospital beds and baby milk formula. Now the shortage of school
places is making headlines.</p>
            <p>The problem dates from a 2001 court
ruling that gives babies born in Hong Kong to mainland mothers the
same benefits as local residents.</p>
            <p>From around 2006, it became a popular practice for mainland
couples to come to the territory for the birth of their children.
Since then more than 180,000 children have been born to mainland
parents in Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>Now many of those children are hitting school age, but the
number of school places has not kept pace.</p>
            <p>Last year, some 6,800 mainland students crossed the border from
the Chinese city of Shenzhen each day to go to school in Hong
Kong.</p>
            <p>For the 2013-14 school year, the education ministry announced
that there were 1,400 more applicants than school spaces available
in the north district closest to the border.</p>
            <p>"It's a 50% increase from the previous year and the competition
is only going to get worse with the influx of mainland Chinese
students," said the head of the North District Primary School Heads
Association, Chan Siu-hung</p>
            <p>To cope with the rising demand, the education bureau has
increased class sizes and sent children to other school districts
using a computerised system that does not discriminate between
children living in Hong Kong or on the mainland.</p>
            <p>This angers Hong Kong mother Zoe Pang, who has just found out
that her son will now have to take a bus ride of almost an hour to
school every day.</p>
            <p>"As taxpayers we are paying for mainland Chinese kids to study
here for the next nine years but my child can't go to school near
home. It's not fair to us," said Ms Pang as she wiped away
tears.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">The issue of "birth tourism" has led to
tensions between Hong Kong and the mainland</span>
            </div>
            <p>Another Hong Kong resident, Chang Liqun, came out feeling lucky
that her son had got into her school of choice but she still feels
the system needs to be improved.</p>
            <p>"I'm not trying to be selfish but I believe that as families who
live in Hong Kong we should be given priority. We're not trying to
discriminate against mainland mothers but there aren't enough
school spaces," she said.</p>
            <p>But the mothers from the mainland say their children have rights
too.</p>
            <p>"Hong Kong's education and other social services are better than
mainland China. I chose to give birth here so that my daughter can
have a better life," said Shenzhen mother Cao Lulu, 35.</p>
            <p>Hong Kong's schools are seen to be based on merit, while in the
mainland bribery has crept into the system. Parents also seem to
prefer Hong Kong's curriculum, where the English language education
is seen as better.</p>
            <p>Other families say that having a Hong Kong passport makes it
easier for their child to study in Western countries.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Some Chinese parents see Hong Kong's
curriculum as better</span>
            </div>
            <p>A mother from Shenzhen (she would only give her daughter's name
and not hers before running off) was one big smile when she found
out her daughter had got into her top school choice.</p>
            <p>"I'm so happy, thank you," she said, bowing towards reporters.
"All of our children are born in Hong Kong so they should be
treated as equals."</p>
            <p>Increasingly though, the Hong Kong government is under pressure
to ensure that local residents have preferential access to the
territory's limited resources.</p>
            <p>It has already restricted mainland Chinese from buying too much
baby milk formula and banned public hospitals from accepting
pregnant mainland mothers.</p>
            <p>Officials say both measures have been a success.</p>
            <p>That gives little comfort to Hong Kong resident Ho Mei Yin. Her
six-year-old daughter did not get a place in a school near her
home.</p>
            <p>The little girl's name is now on a waiting list in case anyone
forfeits their place. Ms Ho will find out this month if she is
successful.</p>
            <p>But even if she jumps this hurdle, Ms Ho believes her child will
have to continue competing for resources with other children along
the border as she gets older.</p>
