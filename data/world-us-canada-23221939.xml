warzone here''</p>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper says
the part of Lac-Megantic affected by Saturday's crude oil explosion
looks like a "war zone".</p>
            <p>At least five people died when runaway train cars packed with
crude oil derailed and blew up early on Saturday.</p>
            <p>Some 30 buildings had been completely incinerated by fires which
engulfed the historic centre, said Mr Harper.</p>
            <p>Police are trying to find 40 missing people: a nearby bar was
said to have been crowded at the time of the blast.</p>
            <p>"This is an enormous area, 30 buildings just completely
destroyed, for all intents and purposes incinerated,'' Harper said.
``There isn't a family that is not affected by this.''</p>
            <p>The fires were so intense and burnt for so long that Quebec
police warn some bodies may never be recovered.</p>
            <p>The five bodies found are so charred they have been sent to
Montreal for identification, police say.</p>
            <p>Fires were finally extinguished early on Sunday evening.</p>
            <p>"The flames, the fires all have been put out now. We did it,"
said fire chief Denis Lauzon.</p>
            <p>Visiting the affected area on Sunday, Mr Harper said an
"unbelievable disaster" had befallen Lac-Megantic, which is around
250km (155 miles) east of Montreal.</p>
            <p>Saturday's pre-dawn explosion sent a fireball and black smoke
into the air, forcing the evacuation of 2,000 people.</p>
            <p>"This is an enormous area, 30 buildings just completely
destroyed, for all intents and purposes incinerated," said Mr
Harper. "There isn't a family that is not affected by this."</p>
            <p>He added: "There'll be investigations to ascertain what's
occurred and make sure it can't happen again."</p>

            <p>Firefighters had been battling the flames
with water and a fire retardant, but were staying at least 1,000 ft
from the burning tankers for fear of more blasts, Mr Lauzon told
reporters earlier on Sunday.</p>
            <p>"We lost the bibliotheque [library] which had all the memories
of people here - it's a mess," said Chief Lauzon.</p>
            <p>People whose homes have been badly damaged were being given
shelter at a nearby school.</p>
            <p>The Montreal, Maine &amp; Atlantic train had been parked in the
village of Nantes - about 7km (four miles) from Lac-Megantic -
during an overnight driver shift-change, said a company
spokesman.</p>

            <p>Its 73 cars carrying pressurised containers of crude oil somehow
became uncoupled from five locomotive engines, gathering speed as
they rolled downhill before derailing in the heart of
Lac-Megantic.</p>
            <p>Bernard Demers, who runs a restaurant near the blast site, said
the fireball that followed the derailment at around 01:00 (05:00
GMT) on Saturday was "like an atomic bomb", the Sunday Telegraph
reported.</p>
            <p>The train had been travelling from the Bakken Field in North
Dakota to a refinery in Saint John, New Brunswick.</p>
            <p>Montreal, Maine &amp; Atlantic owns more than 800km (500 miles)
of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and New Brunswick.</p>
            <p>A picturesque lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Maine.</p>
