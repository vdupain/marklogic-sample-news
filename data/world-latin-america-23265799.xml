               <span style="width:304px;">Protests across the country have not stopped the
controversial Belo Monte dam project</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Brazilian indigenous
people in the Amazon region have blocked one of the country's most
important railways in a protest for better public services.</p>
            <p>The railway is owned by mining giant Vale and connects the
world's largest iron ore mine, Carajas, to a port on the northern
coast near Sao Luis.</p>
            <p>The track transports more than 100m tonnes of the mineral each
year.</p>
            <p>It is the second time this week that the trains have been halted
by protesters of neighbouring villages.</p>
            <p>Protesters from several tribes burned wood on the railway in the
Amazonian region of Alto Alegre do Pindare, demanding better
transport, education, health and security.</p>
            <p>Last week, they blocked the railway for two days.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, residents of another village near Sao Luis,
in the state of Maranhao, also stopped the trains in a protest.</p>
            <p>They want Vale to act on their behalf in negotiations with the
authorities.</p>
            <div class="caption body-narrow-width">

                 alt="map"/>
            </div>
            <p>Because of the protests, the passenger train that transports
about 1,500 passengers a day between the city of Parauapebas, in
Para, and Sao Luis has not resumed its regular service since last
week.</p>
            <p>Despite having a court authorisation to evict the protesters at
any time, Vale chose not to enforce it, the world's second largest
mining company said in a statement.</p>
            <p>The demonstrations came about a month after several thousand
Brazilians took to the streets of the country's major cities in a
wave of protests against poor public services, corruption and the
cost of staging the 2014 World Cup.</p>
            <p>Vale has faced several protests from indigenous peoples of the
region in the past, more recently because of its expansion plans
for the 892km-long railway.</p>
            <p>Despite court challenges and fierce criticism, work on a second
line along its railway to the coast is under way.</p>
            <p>Elsewhere in the Amazon, land grabbing, illegal logging and
mining conflicts are common grievances.</p>
            <p>But the giant Belo Monte hydroelectric dam project has been the
focus of most protests and clashes.</p>
            <p>The Brazilian government says it is needed to guarantee Brazil's
energy provision, especially in the Amazon region, which still
relies heavily on fossil fuels.</p>
            <p>Critics say the controversial project will cause irreversible
social, cultural and environmental damage.</p>
            <p>So far, however, demonstrations and court challenges have failed
to prevent it from going ahead.</p>
