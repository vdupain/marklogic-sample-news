            <p class="introduction">Rolls-Royce has
denied claims made by two former employees in a US lawsuit that it
"cut corners on quality control requirements" and "lied to"
customers.</p>
            <p>The pair also alleged that the firm "routinely used defective
parts designated as 'scrap only'".</p>
            <p>The two are challenging a court order that prevents them from
releasing information which they claim reveals details of what the
firm concealed.</p>
            <p>Rolls-Royce has defended itself and said the lawsuit is "without
merit".</p>
            <p>According to reports in the Financial Times and the Daily
Telegraph, the lawsuit filed by former employees Thomas McArtor and
Keith Ramsey alleges that the engine maker concealed internal
records of defects in engines sold to clients.</p>
            <p>The employees claims that the company collated those alleged
defects into a "secret set of books".</p>
            <p>Rolls-Royce has denied these allegations saying that a US
district Judge, William T Lawrence, had already thrown out two of
the four claims before the "discovery" phase of the litigation had
been entered.</p>
            <p>"Judge Lawrence did not find that Rolls-Royce engaged in any
wrongdoing, failed to follow its quality system, concealed anything
from the US government or even that a jury is entitled to hear the
allegations," the firm said.</p>
            <p>"Rolls-Royce categorically rejects the other claims and will
defend itself vigorously.</p>
            <p>"Any and all facts of the case will be presented in court, where
we are confident it will be found the lawsuit is without merit," it
added.</p>
