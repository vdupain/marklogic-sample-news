            <p class="introduction">France, Greece and
Italy have been the "targets" of US spying operations, according to
the latest files leaked to Britain's Guardian newspaper.</p>
            <p>Citing a document by the National Security Agency, it says
America's non-European allies were also targeted.</p>
            <p>The claim follows a report by Germany's Der Spiegel magazine
saying EU offices had been bugged. EU leaders have demanded an
explanation from the US.</p>
            <p>Fugitive ex-CIA analyst Edward Snowden is said to have leaked
the documents.</p>
            <p>Mr Snowden - a former contractor for the CIA and the NSA - has
since requested asylum from Ecuador. He is currently in Russia,
marooned at Moscow's airport after US authorities cancelled his
passport.</p>
            <p>In response to the allegations in Der Spiegel, senior EU
officials, France and Germany have warned that relations with
America could suffer.</p>
            <p>The NSA said the US government would respond through diplomatic
channels and discussions with the countries involved.</p>

            </div>
            <p>According to a 2010 secret document leaked to the Guardian, all
in all 38 embassies and missions were described by the NSA as
"targets".</p>
            <p>The paper says the file provides details of "an extraordinary
range" of spying methods, including bugs implanted in electronic
communications gear, taps into cable and the usage of specialised
antennae.</p>
            <p>The report mentions codenames of alleged operations against the
French and Greek missions to the UN, as well as the Italian embassy
in Washington.</p>
            <p>The paper adds that the list of targets also includes "a number
of other American allies, including Japan, Mexico, South Korea,
India and Turkey".</p>
            <p>The Guardian also cites another leaked report from 2007, which
said a bug was placed in an encrypted fax machine at the EU mission
in Washington.</p>
            <p>According to the document cited by Der Spiegel - which it says
also comes from the NSA - the agency spied on EU internal computer
networks in Washington and at the 27-member bloc's UN office in New
York.</p>
            <p>On Sunday French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said that if
confirmed, the activities would be "totally unacceptable".</p>
            <p>German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said
the alleged US behaviour "recalls the methods used by enemies
during the Cold War".</p>
            <p>The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, warned
that any such spying could have a "severe impact" on ties between
the EU and the US.</p>
            <p>The European Commission, which plays a key role in trade talks,
has officially asked Washington to investigate the allegations.</p>
