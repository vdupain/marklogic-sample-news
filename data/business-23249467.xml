               <span style="width:624px;">Is the sun setting on South Africa's gold
mines?</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Visitors flying into
Johannesburg's airports gaze down upon the small, seemingly regular
hills that ring the city that is known in Zulu as eGoli, "place of
gold".</p>
            <p>These mine dumps are testament to the millions of tonnes of
earth that have been shifted in the search for gold around the city
over the past 130 years.</p>
            <p>But the gold mining industry that gave rise to one of Africa's
biggest cities is now in crisis.</p>
            <p>Costs, including wages, have escalated over the past two decades
and the gold itself is getting harder to get to.</p>
            <p>Some analysts describe the gold sector as in terminal decline -
a sunset industry.</p>
            <p>Crucial wage negotiations start in South Africa's gold mining
sector on Thursday, the outcome of which, some analysts say, will
determine the future of the whole industry.</p>
            <p>Billions of dollars in exports and tens of thousands of jobs are
at stake.</p>
            <p>It's been a turbulent 18 months for South Africa's entire mining
industry, not just gold, with workers across several sectors
staging wildcat strikes.</p>
            <p>The tensions over the mines has often boiled over into violence,
including the most infamous day in South Africa's post-apartheid
history last August, when <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19292909">34 miners were
shot dead by police near Lonmin's Marikana platinum mine</a>.</p>
            <p>The South African government is so concerned that it tasked
Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe to try to broker a stability
pact for the industry. The ruling ANC faces elections next year and
is keen to avoid another flare-up of violence.</p>
            <p>While mining only contributes about 6% of South Africa's GDP
(financial services and manufacturing command larger slices), it
generates nearly 60% of the country's exports.</p>
            <p>But the opening positions of the players involved seem to be so
far apart that the negotiations are likely to be racked by tension,
deadlock and possible walkouts.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">More than 80% of mineworkers are
unionised</span>
            </div>
            <p>The two big unions, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and
the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), have
demanded pay increases of 60% and 100% respectively.</p>
            <p>The gold mining companies say that double-digit increases are
unaffordable.</p>
            <p>Analysts expect months of industrial action on a scale that
could be worse than that seen last year.</p>
            <p>That would leave the entire sector in a precarious position and
would have severe knock-on consequences for the South African
economy as a whole.</p>
            <p>The ratings agencies Standard &amp; Poors and Moody's downgraded
the country's debt last year, partly due to worries over the mining
sector.</p>
            <p>The Chamber of Mines, which represents the mining houses, says a
widespread strike in the gold mines would mean a loss of 349m rand
($34m; Ã‚Â£23m) for each day of lost
production.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the loss of miners' wages in a strike would result in
the government losing 9m rand in tax revenues every day.</p>

            <p>Much of the easily accessible gold has
already been taken out of the ground. That which lies in the deeper
reefs is becoming increasingly costly and dangerous to get at.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, over the past five years, wages have
increased by an average of 12.3% per year, compared with an average
inflation rate of 5.9%.</p>
            <p>During the same time, gold production fell by 21%. Last year,
the average worker produced 1.18kg of gold. In 2007, that figure
was 1.49kg.</p>
            <p>Last month, the World Gold Council released new guidelines for
calculating the true cost of producing the metal.</p>
            <p>The new "all-in" measure takes account of capital expenditure
and licensing for the first time, as well as the day-to-day running
costs.</p>
            <p>This significantly raises the cost of producing an ounce of
gold.</p>
            <p>Gold Fields chief executive Nick Holland said the new method
would mean an ounce of gold would cost nearly $1,400 to produce. At
a time when the gold price has fallen to about $1,200, this makes
many mines unprofitable.</p>

               <span style="width:464px;">Wildcat strikes are common in South Africa's
mines</span>
            </div>
            <p>But Loane Sharp, a labour analyst with Adcorp, says the
complaints made by the mining companies about the price of gold
(over which they have no control) are somewhat overdone. For
example, 10 years ago the price of gold was closer to $300 an ounce
and many mines were still profitable.</p>
            <p>"In many cases complaints about the gold price are a ruse, since
the uncontrollable gold price allows mine management to divert
attention from their own role in mine profitability, namely control
of costs," he says.</p>
            <p>Analysts say if the mining companies are
forced to grant high wage increases, they will simply counter this
with massive layoffs.</p>
            <p>Firms have also embarked on programmes of mechanisation,
basically replacing workers with machines.</p>
            <p>Loane Sharp points out that while mine production between 1990
and 2012 increased, the labour force shank from 1.2 million to
514,000 - the result of mechanisation.</p>
            <p>Both sides in the wage negotiations recognise the need to reach
common ground.</p>
            <p>"We believe the minerals of this country must now benefit the
people," AMCU said in its demands to the gold companies.</p>
            <p>"But unless the wage talks reach an outcome that reflects the
balance sheet realities, neither companies nor workers can salvage
a gold industry crushed between a toppling price and climbing
costs."</p>
            <p>While Mark Cutifani, chief executive of Anglo American and the
president of the Chamber of Mines, said: "The future of the mining
industry is in our collective hands and by working together we can
ensure its sustainability and return it to profitability for the
benefit of all South Africans."</p>
            <p>But while the public statements by the players talk of solutions
found collectively, there will be hard bargaining and tough
decisions made in the coming months. Much is at stake in an
industry that could be entering its twilight years.</p>
