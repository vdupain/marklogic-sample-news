               <span style="width:304px;">Gay weddings resumed across California
on Friday</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Opponents of
same-sex marriage in California have filed an emergency petition to
the US Supreme Court to try to halt gay weddings in the state.</p>
            <p>The move comes a day after a federal appeals court in San
Francisco lifted a ban that had been in place since 2008.</p>
            <p>Many Californian gay couples then rushed to get married.</p>
            <p>But the opponents say the appeals court acted prematurely
because by law they had more time to appeal before the ban can be
lifted.</p>
            <p>Friday's decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals court
followed a ruling by the US Supreme Court against supporters of the
California ban on gay marriage.</p>
            <p>On Saturday the Alliance Defending Freedom, which supports the
ban, filed the petition asking the Supreme Court to overrule the
order by appeals court.</p>
            <p>The group argued that by law it had 25 days to challenge the
Supreme Court ruling, and therefore that the ban should not have
been lifted.</p>
            <p>The Alliance Defending Freedom described the appeals court order
as "the latest in a long line of judicial irregularities".</p>
            <p>The gay marriage ban - known as Proposition 8 - was approved by
voters in 2008, months after California's supreme court decided
such unions were legal.</p>
            <p>The two couples then launched the legal challenge. As the state
of California refused to defend the proposition, the group that
sponsored it stepped up to do so.</p>
            <p>But on Wednesday the Supreme Court ruled that a private party
could not challenge the earlier lower court ruling, as it could not
demonstrate it would suffer injury if same-sex marriages were
allowed.</p>
