            <p class="introduction">Star Wars director
George Lucas is to be honoured with the National Medal of Arts at a
White House ceremony next week.</p>
            <p>The 69-year-old is among 12 recipients being recognised for
their cultural contributions to the US.</p>
            <p>The White House praised the director for "combining the art of
storytelling with boundless imagination and cutting-edge
techniques".</p>
            <p>President Barack Obama will award the medals next Wednesday.</p>
            <p>"Mr Lucas has transported us to new worlds and created some of
the most beloved and iconic films of all time," the White House
added.</p>
            <p>Herb Alpert, the co-founder of A&amp;M Records and the Tijuana
Brass is among the other recipients.</p>
            <p>Honoured for his contribution to music and the fine arts, the
Grammy-winner is best-known for his 1979 instrumental hit Rise and
worked with the likes of The Carpenters, Sergio Mendes and Janet
Jackson.</p>
            <p>Playwright and screenwriter Tony Kushner, best known for 1993 Al
Pacino film Angels in America will also be honoured, as will
screenwriter Elaine May, who was Oscar nominated for the films
Primary Colors and Heaven Can Wait.</p>
            <p>"With groundbreaking wit and a keen understanding of how humour
can illuminate our lives, May has evoked untold joy, challenged
expectations, and elevated spirits across our nation," her citation
said.</p>
            <p>Others to receive awards include Lin Arison, co-founder of the
National Young Arts Foundation and the New World Symphony; Joan
Myers Brown, the founder of the Philadelphia Dance Company; opera
singer Renee Fleming; author Ernest Gaines; artist Ellsworth Kelly;
landscape architect Laurie Olin and composer Allen Toussaint.</p>
            <p>The Washington Performing Arts Society will also be honoured for
"bringing world-class performances to our Nation's capital".</p>
