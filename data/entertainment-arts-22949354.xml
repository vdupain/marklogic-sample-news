            <p class="introduction">Daniel Radcliffe has
impressed critics with his "understated" performance as a disabled
orphan in The Cripple of Inishmaan.</p>
            <p>The Harry Potter star has returned to the London stage in
Michael Grandage's revival of Martin McDonagh's 1996 play.</p>
            <p>"It's a knowing play but one which Radcliffe invests with a
sense of real feeling," said Michael Billington in his four-star
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2013/jun/18/the-cripple-of-inishmaan-review">
Guardian</a> review.</p>
            <p>The play runs at the Noel Coward Theatre until 31 August.</p>
            <p>In the story, set in 1934, disabled teenager Billy Claven
(Radcliffe) lives with his "aunties" on the isle of Inishmaan off
the west coast of Ireland.</p>

               <span style="width:224px;">Daniel Radcliffe plays a disabled orphan known
locally as Cripple Billy</span>
            </div>
            <p>Constantly mocked by the islanders, he survives the tedium of
daily life by reading books and staring at cows. But the arrival of
a Hollywood film-maker on a neighbouring island offers him a chance
of escape to a glamorous new life.</p>
            <p>"With his twisted left arm and inflexible left leg, he suggests
Billy's disability without overstating it," said Billington.</p>
            <p>"Radcliffe also has the precious gift, vital in a play full of
narrative surprises, of seeming artful and vulnerable at the same
time."</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/10127301/The-Cripple-of-Inishmaan-Noel-Coward-Theatre-review.html">
Daily Telegraph'</a>s Charles Spencer said Radcliffe gave
McDonagh's play "its much-needed heart".</p>
            <p>"Radcliffe brings a touching stoicism and simplicity to his
performance as Cripple Billy, all the more moving because it is so
understated," he said.</p>
            <p>"It is surprising to find Michael Grandage directing this black
comedy, as he is normally the most humane of directors. But it has
to be admitted that the piece is theatrically effective,
outstandingly acted and often disgracefully funny."</p>
            <p>In the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2344217/The-Cripple-Inishmaan-Gritty-Its-decent-attempt-far-flattering-role-Daniel-Radcliffe.html">
Daily Mail</a>, Quentin Letts said Radcliffe shared the stage with
"a beltingly good Irish cast who bejabber and begorrah away in
Martin McDonagh's zany take on Oirishness".</p>
            <p>"Mr Radcliffe just about survives as Billy. Given the talent he
is alongside in Michael Grandage's confident production, that is an
achievement."</p>
            <p>Paul Taylor, in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/theatre-review-daniel-radcliffe-gives-an-admirably-honest-performance-the-cripple-of-inishmaan--but-his-irish-accent-isnt-quite-there-8663412.html">
The Independent</a>, pointed out Radcliffe "may not have the most
convincing Irish accent". But he praised the 23-year-old actor's
"honest, sensitive, unshowy performance".</p>

            </div>
            <p>In the <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/the-cripple-of-inishmaan-noel-coward-theatre--theatre-review-8664318.html">
Standard</a>, Henry Hitchings highlighted the strengths of
Radcliffe's fellow cast members, with particular praise for Gillian
Hanna and Ingrid Craigie as Billy's adopted aunts as well as Pat
Shortt's Johnnypateenmike and his mother, given "a sour fierceness"
by June Watson.</p>
            <p>"There are plenty of laughs - many of them guilty ones - along
the way. And Radcliffe's desire to challenge himself is admirable,
as is his refusal to milk his part and instead deliver a
performance of moving modesty," he added.</p>
            <p>
               <a href="http://www.theartsdesk.com/theatre/cripple-inishmaan-no%C3%ABl-coward-theatre">
The Arts Desk</a>'s Veronica Lee was less impressed with the
performance by the former boy wizard.</p>
            <p>"Although it's an ensemble piece, Radcliffe - not yet free of
Harry Potter references despite his West End and Broadway
successes, but he's getting there - is the marquee attraction here,
yet turns in a lacklustre performance in a play brimful with
deliberately showy characters."</p>
            <p>The Guardian's Billington, however, concluded that "the evening
belongs to Radcliffe, who has successfully escaped from the
Potter's wheel".</p>
