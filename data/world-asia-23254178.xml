            <p class="introduction">A 5.7m (19ft) python
has been seized after it fell from the ceiling of a charity shop in
Australia.</p>
            <p>The python, weighing 17kg (37lbs), was recovered by a
snake-handler after police investigated a suspected break-in at the
shop in Ingham, Queensland.</p>
            <p>"Its head was the size of a small dog," said police spokesman
Sgt Don Auld.</p>
            <p>The snake fell through a ceiling panel, smashing shop goods.
Police said it may have got in through the roof, which was damaged
by Cyclone Yasi in 2011.</p>
            <p>When police were initially called to the property on Monday,
they believed a person had fallen through the ceiling because the
roof panel had been cut in half.</p>
            <p>Crockery, clothes and other goods were scattered all over the
floor.</p>
            <p>Police were called back to the shop the following day when a
large crowd formed outside.</p>
            <p>Sgt Auld said the snake must have been hiding when police went
there the first time.</p>
            <p>It has been released in nearby wetlands.</p>
