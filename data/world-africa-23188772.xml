            <p class="introduction">Zimbabwe's
Constitutional Court has rejected an appeal to delay elections set
for 31 July.</p>
            <p>Both President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan
Tsvangirai had asked for the elections to be postponed.</p>
            <p>Mr Tsvangirai argued that Zimbabwe needed more time to prepare
for a free and fair election.</p>
            <p>The two men have been in a fractious coalition government since
disputed elections in 2008 but will again face each other this
year.</p>
            <p>"For the avoidance of doubt, elections should proceed on the
31st of July in terms of the proclamation by the president of
Zimbabwe in compliance with the order of this court," Chief Justice
Godfrey Chidyausiku said, according to Reuters news agency.</p>
            <p>Mr Tsvangirai accepted the ruling, his spokesman Luke
Tamborinyoka said, it reports.</p>
            <p>"Since the court has ruled, it means we have to go by that
date," he is quoted as saying.</p>
            <p>Last month, Mr Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)
said the voters roll was in a "shambles" and the vote could be
rigged.</p>
            <p>Following an initial court ruling, Mr Mugabe had called
elections for 31 July but asked the court for a postponement
following pressure from Mr Tsvangirai and regional leaders.</p>
            <p>The court said it would give reasons for its decision later.</p>
            <p>The election would herald the end of the coalition government
the two leaders formed after the 2008 poll.</p>
            <p>Mr Mugabe, 89, and Tsvangirai, 61, will contest the election
again.</p>
            <p>Mr Tsvangirai pulled out of the second round of the 2008
election, accusing the security forces and pro-Mugabe militias of
attacking his supporters around the country.</p>
            <p>Mr Mugabe denied any links to the violence.</p>
