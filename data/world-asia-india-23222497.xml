            <p class="introduction">At least 12 people
have been killed in a building collapse in the southern Indian city
of Secunderabad, police say.</p>
            <p>At least 18 more people were injured when the two-storey City
Light hotel came crashing down on Monday morning.</p>
            <p>Police said it was not clear how many people were trapped under
the debris at the hotel, located near Hyderabad.</p>
            <p>Correspondents say such incidents are common in India and are
often blamed on poor construction practices.</p>
            <p>About 25 people were working at the hotel, located on a busy
road in Secunderabad, when one of its kitchen walls collapsed,
burying some of the employees, senior police official B Surender
told the AFP news agency.</p>
            <p>"The building was very old and the walls showed cracks,
according to people working nearby," he added.</p>
            <p>Last month, nine people were killed in two separate building
collapses in the western city of Mumbai.</p>
            <p>In April, 74 people were killed in another building collapse on
the outskirts of Mumbai.</p>
