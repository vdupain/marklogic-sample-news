Colombian government in Havana on Monday</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Colombia's largest
armed rebel groups, the Farc and ELN, have met "to strengthen"
their "unification process".</p>
            <p>In a statement, the Farc says "incidents which led to the
distancing between the groups" have been overcome.</p>
            <p>The development comes as Farc leaders resume peace negotiations
with the Colombian government in Cuba.</p>
            <p>They are discussing how Farc could enter politics if a deal is
reached to end five decades of conflict.</p>
            <p>According to the Farc statement, the meeting with the ELN
(National Liberation Army) at an undisclosed location discussed the
need to "work for the unity of all political and social forces"
involved in changing the country.</p>
            <p>The two groups have clashed in the past but have recently joined
forces in armed operations against government targets in
Colombia.</p>
            <p>The ELN - Colombia's second largest group - is not part of the
peace talks in Cuba.</p>
            <p>But its leaders have made clear they would like to
participate.</p>
            <p>Talks between the Colombian government and the Farc resumed in
Havana on Monday on the second key issue on the peace agenda: how
to bring the rebel group into the political process after a future
peace deal.</p>
            <p>They reached an agreement on land reform
late in May.</p>
            <p>Farc leaders want general elections be put back a year, to 2015,
to allow for a constituent assembly to draw up Colombia's political
future.</p>
            <p>But the government has warned it will only discuss the
previously agreed agenda.</p>
            <p>"The political participation discussion is only over these
issues. This is what the government is ready to discuss and nothing
else," Colombia's chief negotiator, Humberto de la Calle said.</p>
            <p>Landmark peace negotiations have been going on in Cuba for more
than six months.</p>
            <p>The Farc is thought to have some 8,000 fighters, down from about
16,000 in 2001, while the government says the ELN has fewer than
1,500 men.</p>
            <p>The government estimates that 600,000 people have been killed
since the conflict began in the 1960s, with some three million more
internally displaced by the fighting.</p>
