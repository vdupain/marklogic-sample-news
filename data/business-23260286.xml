               <span style="width:624px;">Working 9-5: If you start counting the
clock from the moment you slump behind your desk you're not alone -
70% of US workers, and many many more people around the world are
right there with you</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Are you happy at work?</p>
            <p>If that seems like a loaded question -
can you at least say you're interested in what you're doing, and
feel motivated?</p>
            <p>If the answer is no, don't worry. You're not alone. In fact a
massive <a href="http://www.gallup.com/strategicconsulting/163007/state-american-workplace.aspx">
70% of US workers are "not engaged" or are "actively disengaged" at
work</a>. Workers elsewhere <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/07/10/work-makes-people-miserable/">
appear to agree</a>.</p>
            <p>So what can we do about it?</p>
            <p>Dave Coplin has a few ideas.</p>
            <p>He is Microsoft UK's chief envisioner. But he's also something
of an influential expert when it comes to how we work.</p>
            <p>It's something he's passionate about, and that comes across
clearly in his new book <a href="http://www.harriman-house.com/book/view/557/business/dave-coplin/business-reimagined/">
Business Reimagined: Why work isn't working and what you can do
about it</a>.</p>

               <span style="width:304px;">Dave Coplin believes for companies to thrive they
need to change the way their employees work</span>
            </div>
            <p>"Fundamentally I think work isn't working," he says.</p>
            <p>"We ended up in containers that are no longer relevant, we still
think about work as a destination when we should think about it is
as an activity.</p>
            <p>"It's something that we do, it's not a place we go - I can work
from anywhere."</p>
            <p>He sees technology is part of the problem. Rather than creating
a world where the ability to work anywhere frees us up to enjoy
life a little more, he sees the opposite happening.</p>
            <p>"I grew up on Star Trek and comic books, and had this belief
that technology is a force that is supposed to bring positive
things to society.</p>
            <p>"Then I look around at what we're doing and I see how technology
has become a cage to lots of people."</p>
            <div class="caption body-narrow-width">
               <img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/68685000/jpg/_68685799_startrek624.jpg"
                 width="304"
                 height="171"
                 alt="Mr Spock and alien woman"/>
               <span style="width:304px;">Prime directive: Star Trek promised a
clean world of job satisfaction powered by technology</span>
            </div>
            <p>He cites email as a particular example of an out-dated use of
technology - using email for everything, rather than pick up the
phone, say, or using other collaborative applications. This, he
says, stifles both productivity and creativity.</p>
            <p>As well as spending hours in the office dealing with it, we've
become trapped by the need check our email weekends, evenings, at
the school play, at the supermarket, wherever we are.</p>
            <p>This is partly self-inflicted and partly down to corporate
culture and a basic misunderstanding of how these tools should be
used says Mr Coplin.</p>
            <p>"We allow technology to overtake us, and this way we become
slaves to it, so all of these things conspire.</p>
            <p>"I know there is more to technology, I know what it can do, I
see this stuff we do, the stuff that our competitors do, the
potential technology offers a modern society whether it's just work
or play.</p>
            <p>"It's huge and the challenge is, unless we open our eyes to use
that we're never going to get that."</p>
            <p>Part of the change Mr Coplin is advocating involves the physical
spaces where we do our jobs.</p>
            <p>The office was originally the place work had to be done.</p>
            <div class="caption full-width">

               <span style="width:624px;">Open all hours: Offices like this are now the norm -
but kill creativity and make us less productive, says Dave
Coplin</span>
            </div>
            <p>Then it was the only place that had the technology necessary to
do your job. Now, most of us have better devices at home.</p>
            <p>"One of the basic premises of our theory is that the future
belongs to creativity. So if we are going to be more competitive as
businesses, we are going to do more things differently," he
says.</p>
            <p>"If you buy that theory open plan offices are terrible."</p>
            <p>The argument is that the large open spaces so beloved of modern
architects and HR departments ends up destroying the very things
they were supposed to nurture and encourage.</p>
            <div class="caption full-width">
               <img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/68685000/jpg/_68685796_antelope624.jpg"

                 height="351"
                 alt="Antelopes on the plain"/>
               <span style="width:624px;">You are here: The modern open plan
office environment and the Darwinian environment of the African
plains have a lot in common, according to Ben
Hammersley</span>
            </div>
            <p>Technologist and writer Ben Hammersley wrote the introduction to
the book.</p>
            <p>He likens them to the African savannah - herds of antelopes - or
staff - in groups, while at the edge sit the hunters, the managers,
with their screens shielded, ready to pounce on the weak or visibly
unproductive.</p>
            <p>Recent research says these offices <a href="http://qz.com/85400/moving-to-open-plan-offices-makes-employees-less-productive-less-happy-and-more-likely-to-get-sick/">
make us sick, less productive and unhappy</a>.</p>
            <p>To do our best work, we need to get into something called a
'flow state' - it takes the average human 15 minutes to get
there.</p>
            <p>"When was the last time you had 15 minutes where you weren't
distracted by a phone call, email or someone telling you about last
night's Eastenders?" says Mr Coplin.</p>
            <p>The answer, says Mr Coplin, is to embrace a flatter hierarchy
while giving your staff freedom to work flexibly.</p>
            <p>But this doesn't necessarily mean what you think it does.</p>
            <p>"When I talk to people about flexible working, what they will
typically say, oh you mean working from home?" he says.</p>
            <p>"Well, sort of. Actually what I really mean is being mindful of
the location that you are going to be to be able to do the work you
have do today. And being really thoughtful about what that is."</p>
            <p>The other problem is that working flexibly is often seen as a
perk for individuals or people with children - and causes trust
issues.</p>
            <div class="caption full-width">
               <img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/68685000/jpg/_68685794_working624.jpg"
                 width="624"
                 height="351"
                 alt="Woman working"/>
               <span style="width:624px;">Moving target: Flexible working doesn't mean sitting
at home on the sofa, according to Dave Coplin</span>
            </div>
            <p>But Mr Coplin's research turned up something interesting.</p>
            <p>"The [trust] issue is not between the employer and employee like
we thought it would be, it is actually between employees."</p>
            <p>The fear of earning your colleague's disdain results in
sometimes paranoid behaviour.</p>
            <p>"I start to do stupid things. I start to send more emails, I get
up early, send a really early email, and then all of a sudden, I am
not using the tools effectively," he explains.</p>
            <p>"I am doing this because I am worrying about what they are going
to be saying."</p>
            <p>"You [have to] make it an organisational objective, you say that
actually, yes, it is important for individuals but we believe that
every single member of the workforce should have the capability to
work flexibly."</p>
            <p>Although Mr Coplin points out that certain jobs and professions
obviously do require bodies on site.</p>
            <p>All of this of course hinges on the right technology. And that
means using the right tools in the right way, according to Mr
Coplin, building his definition of the social enterprise. Simply
running a Twitter feed doesn't count.</p>
            <p>"We're locked into this really bizarre world where we have a
richer technology experience at home than most people have at work.
We now communicate really differently at home and in our personal
lives than we communicate at work."</p>
            <p>"You see the power of what you can do socially, but you see the
constraints on how you share and collaborate at work.</p>
            <div class="caption full-width">
               <img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/68678000/jpg/_68678500_floor624.jpg"
                 width="624"
                 height="351"
                 alt="Woman on the floor"/>
               <span style="width:624px;">Falling down: If this is how office life makes you
feel, it might be time for a change of scenery</span>
            </div>
            <p>"It's going to start to merge, because I think [people have] a
higher expectation of how to collaborate."</p>
            <p>This is a democratisation knowledge and participation that Mr
Coplin says could help employees feel more invested in their
employer.</p>
            <p>He describes the 'Ask Me' group used by IT company Merlin, where
staff post questions and get answers from people across the company
and around the world - shortcutting the route to the right person
with the right knowledge.</p>
            <p>Despite all this, the majority of organisations that have tried
to implement social collaboration have failed.</p>
            <p>If this is so beneficial to business, how
can this be?</p>
            <p>According to Mr Coplin, companies can't be half-hearted - these
policies and technologies have to be integrating into fabric of
what people do, rather used in barely-supported pockets, or in
isolation, where they languish and die. As with flexible working,
it should be for everyone, not a 'special' few.</p>
            <p>"We talk about flexible working, social collaboration, managing
people differently, to me it's like a conveyor belt of topics," he
says.</p>
            <p>"You don't do those three things and then voila, you have
re-imagined your business. That's just the beginning of how you
start.</p>
            <p>"The most important thing is you've got to think differently
about both the world that you live in, and the opportunities that
lie in front of you as a business, and how you could think
differently."</p>
            <p>As he talks you get a sense of just how passionate he is about
this.</p>
            <p>"It's a philosophy, it's a different state of mind about the
potential of work," states Mr Coplin.</p>
            <p>"I am really lucky, because I sit in this incredible vantage
point called Microsoft, and I can see right across different
sectors, different sizes of customers, see how all this stuff comes
into play.</p>
            <p>You can see the potential that exists ... we've got to
change."</p>
