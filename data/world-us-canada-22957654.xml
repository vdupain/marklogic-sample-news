            <p class="introduction">An Oregon motorist
suspected of running down a US adventure seeker on a quest to
dribble a football from Seattle to Brazil for charity has been
arrested.</p>
            <p>Scott Van Hiatt is charged with criminally negligent homicide in
the death of Richard Swanson.</p>
            <p>Swanson had set off from Seattle in May aiming to reach Sao
Paulo in time for the World Cup opener on 12 June 2014.</p>
            <p>His itinerary would have taken him through 11 countries
including Guatemala, Mexico and Colombia.</p>
            <p>He said he hoped to raise money for the One World Futbol
Project, which donates durable footballs to developing
countries.</p>
            <p>On 14 May, Swanson was hit from behind by a lorry while walking
south in Oregon along a busy coastal highway. Investigators believe
he was not dribbling a football at the time.</p>
            <p>Police said Hiatt stayed at the scene and had been co-operating
with investigators. He faces up to 10 years in prison if
convicted.</p>
            <p>Hiatt has numerous traffic-related violations in his past,
including convictions for failing to drive on the right side of the
road, speeding and driving without insurance, <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2013/06/neskowin_man_arrested_on_accus.html">
the Oregonian newspaper reports</a>.</p>
            <p>Before leaving, Swanson wrote on his now defunct website: "It
will be a trip of a lifetime where I will push myself further than
I ever thought possible."</p>
            <p>In a YouTube video, he added he had always wanted to go to the
World Cup and he wanted to honour the tournament by dribbling a
football.</p>
            <p>After losing a job as a graphic designer, with no mortgage and
two grown sons, Swanson said "all the pieces seemed to fit" for the
trip.</p>
