            <p class="introduction">Two people have been arrested in British
Columbia accused of plotting to plant a bomb outside the provincial
legislature on Canada Day, police say.</p>
            <p>John Stewart Nuttall and Amanda Marie Korody were
self-radicalised and inspired by al-Qaeda, the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police said.</p>
            <p>The two Canadians from Surrey, British Columbia, were arrested
on Monday, which was Canada's national day.</p>
            <p>They are not believed to have been in contact with other
militant groups.</p>
            <p>"Our investigation demonstrated that this was a domestic threat,
without international linkages," said Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP) Assistant Commissioner James Malizia.</p>
            <p>The pair were arrested in the town of Abbotsford and are in
custody in Surrey, police said. They are due in court later on
Tuesday.</p>

               <p class="caption">Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant
Commissioner James Malitzia said the pair "were inspired by
al-Qaeda ideology."</p>
            </div>
            <p>At a press briefing on Tuesday, RCMP officials said the pair had
been charged with conspiring to place an explosive in a public
place with the intent of causing death or serious injury and with
possessing a device to cause an explosion.</p>
            <p>They also face one count of knowingly facilitating a terrorist
activity.</p>
            <p>Authorities displayed images of pressure cookers, which they
said were to be used to make bombs similar to those detonated at
the Boston marathon bombing in April.</p>
            <p>The RCMP said that inside the pressure cookers were nuts, bolts,
nails, washers and other material that could kill or injure
people.</p>
            <p>The arrests are the result of a probe launched in February under
an operation known as Project Souvenir, authorities said.</p>
            <p>"The suspects were committed to acts of violence and discussed a
wide variety of targets and techniques," said Assistant
Commissioner Wayne Rideout.</p>
            <p>He added that there had not been a threat to public safety and
that authorities had intervened to make sure the devices were not
dangerous.</p>
            <p>"These devices were completely under our control, they were
inert, and at no time represented a threat to public safety," the
assistant commissioner added.</p>
