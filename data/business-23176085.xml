               <span style="width:304px;">China has been hit by a series of
milk-related scandals over the past years</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">Food giants Nestle
and Danone have said they will cut prices of some of their infant
milk formula products in China.</p>
            <p>The move comes a day after China launched a probe into alleged
price fixing by foreign infant milk makers.</p>
            <p>Demand for foreign brands has surged in China after tainted milk
scandals resulted in distrust of local rivals.</p>
            <p>Nestle's unit, Wyeth Nutrition, will slash prices by as much as
20%. Danone said it was co-operating with the probe and was
preparing a price-cut proposal.</p>
            <p>Nestle also added that it would not raise prices of any new
products over the next year.</p>
            <p>"Wyeth Nutrition has always respected and been willing to abide
by China's laws and regulations, and is actively cooperating with
the anti-monopoly investigation into the company," the firm was
quoted as saying by the AFP news agency.</p>
            <p>According to some estimates, foreign brands now account for
about half of all infant milk sales in China.</p>
            <p>Nestle, Danone, Mead Johnson Nutrition and Abbott Laboratories
are among the firms that are being investigated by the China's
National Development and Reform Commission.</p>
            <p>Over the past few years China has faced a
series of milk-related scandals.</p>
            <p>In 2008, six infants died of severe kidney damage and an
estimated 300,000 babies suffered from kidney stones after drinking
tainted baby formula.</p>
            <p>The formula, from several major Chinese dairy companies, was
tested and found to contain melamine, an additive that falsely
boosts the protein levels in milk.</p>
            <p>In December 2011 and July 2012, two Chinese companies recalled
baby formula containing high amounts of aflatoxin, a carcinogen
produced by fungus in cows' feed.</p>
            <p>Last year, another company issued a separate recall after
"unusually high" levels of mercury were found in its main line of
infant milk powder.</p>
            <p>That has led to Chinese consumers looking to overseas brands,
triggering a global surge in demand for the products.</p>
            <p>Analysts said that despite the probe against them foreign brands
were likely to remain popular with the consumers.</p>
            <p>"It is hard to believe that domestic challengers are going to
take over from Danone and Nestle in the next couple of years," said
Jon Cox, an analyst with Kepler Cheuvreux.</p>
            <p>"That is some time away, because the issue is that consumers
don't trust the product rather than the absence of local
competitors." he added.</p>
            <p>The surge in Chinese demand has also resulted in various
countries limiting the amount of infant milk purchases.</p>
            <p>Hong Kong, which was the first one to put a ceiling, has barred
customers from purchasing more than two cans of formula a day.
Those caught breaking the rules face up to two years in prison and
a $64,500 fine.</p>
            <p>Countries outside Asia have also had to take similar measures,
with retailers in Australia and the UK limiting the number of cans
of formula that can be sold to a customer within a single day.</p>
