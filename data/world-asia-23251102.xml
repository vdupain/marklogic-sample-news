            <p class="introduction">Masao Yoshida, the
Fukushima nuclear chief who led efforts to stabilise the crippled
plant after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, has died at the
age of 58.</p>
            <p>Mr Yoshida died on Tuesday in a Tokyo hospital, a spokesman for
plant operator Tepco said.</p>
            <p>He had been suffering from oesophagal cancer, which Tepco said
was not linked to his work at the plant.</p>
            <p>Former Prime Minister Naoto Kan praised his "leadership and
decisiveness".</p>
            <p>Masao Yoshida, a Tokyo-educated nuclear engineer, was chief of
the nuclear plant at the time of the disaster.</p>
            <p>The tsunami swamped the plant, knocking out cooling systems to
the reactors, which subsequently melted down.</p>
            <p>Mr Yoshida remained on site with a small team to try to bring
the plant under control.</p>
            <p>On 12 March, he ignored an order from top-level officials to
stop pumping sea water into one of the reactors - actions that were
subsequently seen as having prevented the situation from getting
even worse.</p>
            <p>He later said of the first few days after the earthquake: "There
were several instances when I thought we were all going to die
here. I feared the plant was getting out of control and we would be
finished.''</p>
            <p>He was criticised, however, for not installing adequate measures
against a tsunami while he headed up Tepco's nuclear facility
management division, before the disaster.</p>
            <p>Because of his illness, Masao Yoshida stepped down as plant
chief in December 2011 - the same month Japan declared the facility
stabilised in a "cold shut-down" state.</p>
            <p>"He literally put his life at risk in dealing with the
accident,'' Tepco President Naomi Hirose said. "We keep his wishes
to our heart and do utmost for the reconstruction of Fukushima,
which he tried to save at all cost.''</p>
            <p>Tepco has said it does not believe his illness was linked to
radiation exposure, saying the condition would normally take
between five and 10 years to develop if radiation were to
blame.</p>
            <p>The disaster forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate from
the area around the plant and it remains unclear when they can
return.</p>
            <p>Since the disaster, workers have been cooling reactors by
flushing sea water through them - but this has led to a build-up of
contaminated water which must be stored.</p>
            <p>There have also been a number of leaks of radioactive water at
the plant.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday, Tepco said that concentrations of caesium-134 in
groundwater had soared over the weekend. The company said it was
investigating the source of the leak.</p>
