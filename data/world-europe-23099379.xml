            <p class="introduction">EU leaders have
agreed to open accession talks with Serbia, whose EU bid was long
delayed by a dispute over its breakaway region of Kosovo.</p>
            <p>EU-Serbia negotiations would begin in January 2014 at the
latest, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said at a
Brussels EU summit.</p>
            <p>Talks on an EU association agreement with Kosovo will also get
under way.</p>
            <p>Tensions between Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority and remaining
ethnic Serbs resurfaced this week.</p>
            <p>Stabilisation and association agreements with the EU cover
trade, economic and political relations. They are seen as important
landmarks for applicant countries seeking EU membership.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/137634.pdf"
               title="EU summit conclusions text, pdf - 28 Jun 13">summit
conclusions</a> say that before January "the negotiating framework
will be... confirmed by the European Council" - a sign of the EU
leaders' commitment to membership talks with Serbia.</p>
            <p>The European Commission President, Jose Manuel Barroso, called
the Serbia decision "indeed historic".</p>
            <p>"We very often use the word 'historic' in an abusive manner, but
this is historic. Let's not forget what happened not so long ago in
that part of Europe, with one of the most violent wars we saw - and
now we will start negotiations with Serbia," he told a news
conference after the summit.</p>
            <p>The EU leaders also welcomed the entry of Croatia into the
27-nation bloc, which will happen on Monday. A big celebration is
to take place in the Croatian capital Zagreb on Sunday night.</p>
            <p>Croatia fought a bitter war against Serb forces during the
break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. It will become the EU's
28th member, and the second from former Yugoslavia, after
Slovenia.</p>
            <p>Mr Van Rompuy said EU officials would visit both Serbia and
Kosovo on Monday, in a sign of the EU's commitment to their
integration with the bloc.</p>
            <p>Many countries recognise Kosovo as independent, but Serbia is
among those, including Russia and China, that do not.</p>
            <p>Five of the 27 EU countries do not recognise Kosovo: Spain,
Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Cyprus.</p>

            <p>Under the April deal the ethnic Albanian government in Kosovo
accepted a high degree of autonomy for Serb-majority areas in the
territory's north. Belgrade insisted that the deal did not mean
Serbian recognition of Kosovo's independence.</p>
            <p>In the capital Pristina, ethnic Albanian nationalists clashed
with police outside parliament on Thursday as MPs ratified the deal
with Serbia, brokered by the EU in April.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of protesters carried banners that read "The deal will
not pass" and "A state cannot be built with thieves".</p>
            <p>According to Serbian media, Serbs who gathered to commemorate a
historic battle outside the city on Friday were attacked with
stones after they left the site by bus, and several people
injured.</p>
            <p>They had been marking the Battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389, when
Serbian forces were defeated by an invading army of Ottoman
Turks.</p>
