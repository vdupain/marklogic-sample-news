            <p class="introduction">The captain of the
Costa Concordia cruise ship, which ran aground off Italy, is due to
go on trial on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>Capt Francesco Schettino, 52, faces charges of multiple
manslaughter and abandoning ship.</p>
            <p>Thirty-two people died when the ship hit a rock off the Tuscan
island of Giglio in January 2012 and then tipped onto its side.</p>
            <p>The start of the trial is threatened by a scheduled national
strike by lawyers.</p>
            <p>Capt Schettino has been accused of leaving the luxury liner
before all of the 4,229 passengers were taken off, and steering the
ship too fast and too close to the shore.</p>
            <p>He was allegedly performing a risky night-time sail-past salute
to people on the tiny island of Giglio.</p>
            <p>The ship was holed by rocks on the left-hand side causing the
ship to list, as passengers dined on the first night of the
cruise.</p>
            <p>A chaotic and disorganised evacuation ensued. By the time the
order to evacuate came, the ship was listing so far to one side
that many lifeboats could not be used.</p>
            <p>Capt Schettino denies the charges, and his defence is expected
to argue that no single person was to blame for the accident.</p>
            <p>He claims his manoeuvring of the ship closer to shore saved
lives.</p>
            <p>Mr Schettino is expected in court on Tuesday in Grosseto, a city
90 miles (145km) north-west of Rome which is nearest to the site of
the wreck.</p>
            <p>However, the trial could be delayed by a
week if his lawyers observe a national strike scheduled to start on
Tuesday.</p>
            <p>Four other crew members and the head of the crisis unit of Costa
Cruises have entered plea bargains which will be ruled on in a
separate hearing later this month.</p>
            <p>In addition to the hundreds of survivors seeking compensation,
the local authorities in Giglio are hoping for at least 80m euros
(Ã‚Â£68m; $105m) to make up for alleged lost
revenue and the eyesore that has been on its shoreline for more
than a year.</p>
            <p>Up to 430 witnesses and 250 plaintiffs could be called during
Capt Schettino's trial, the AFP news agency reports.</p>
            <p>His lawyers say he faces a maximum 20 years in jail if found
guilty.</p>
            <p>The Costa Concordia still lies partially submerged off the coast
of Giglio while <a href="http://http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19962191">salvage
crews work to refloat it</a>.</p>
